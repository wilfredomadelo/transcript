1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,204
doesn't go well, because
it's not always going to go well.

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:04,871
And it shouldn't.

3
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:06,239
These (Asian) women are not there.

4
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:06,506
No.

5
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:07,607
Not every single match.

6
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:09,242
And it shouldn't be.

7
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,611
These (Thai) women are not there to all like you.

8
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:19,019
(International) Dating is a little bit like making
sausage. You really don't want to, you

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,855
know, look at the process, but the
end product is usually pretty good.

10
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:25,625
And I will say that, you know, with
the dating, there's good, bad, and ugly.

11
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,428
And, you know, there's going to be
some wonderful things that happen,

12
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,497
and there's going to be some
things that are not so wonderful.

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,731
And, Tom, you and I were talking earlier.

14
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:33,066
I go with eyes wide open.

15
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:33,466
Yeah.

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,469
The bad, everything,
it's going to happen.

17
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:39,539
Here's the key, I think for most
people, they take it too personal.

18
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,575
And it's not personal,
it's about finding a (genuine) match.

19
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:43,076
Right.

20
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:44,477
And when you find a match, it works.

21
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:44,811
Yeah.

22
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,280
And one of the things
that, and you should touch

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,082
on this, because I
think it's really important.

24
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:52,619
A lot of what happens on
these (dating) tours is between the ears.

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:52,952
Yeah.

26
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,154
It's your mindset.

27
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,390
It's how you deal with
things that are coming at you.

28
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,893
Because there's going to be a lot of
things coming at you on a tour, right?

29
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,562
All these (Bangkok) women, the
interpreters, the staff, the

30
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,598
foreign country, the foreign
food, the foreign language.

31
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,233
All this is coming at you.

32
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,701
How do you deal with it?

33
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,536
Do you get overwhelmed?

34
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:10,336
Do you get too nervous?

35
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:11,438
Do you shut down?

36
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:16,543
Or do you just try to relax and listen
to what we're saying and deal with it?

37
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,878
And if something does
not go right, don't pull

38
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:21,247
into a shell, but just say,
okay, you know what?

39
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:22,449
There's another day.

40
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:23,583
There's another opportunity.

41
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:24,651
There's another opportunity.

42
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,753
And if you look at it
that way, you'll do well.

43
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,155
But (Foreigners) some guys, if they go out
on a date and it doesn't go well,

44
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,491
maybe it was a (Asian)woman that
they were really looking forward to,

45
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:34,594
and it just doesn't go well, because
it's not always going to go well.

46
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:35,261
And it shouldn't.

47
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,629
These (Thai) women are not there.

48
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:36,896
No.

49
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,997
Not every single match.

50
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,632
And it shouldn't be.

51
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:42,001
These women are not there to all like you.

52
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,204
Like, they're not being paid to like you.

53
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,373
It's not like, what was that Westworld
where they were all machines?

54
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:48,274
Remember that movie?

55
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,677
And they were robots, and
they went in, and they, yeah.

56
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,411
It's not like that.

57
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,314
These are real (Asian) women
with real lives, with real

58
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:57,217
problems, with real things
going on in their lives.

59
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,252
They're not in a box
waiting for us to come over.

60
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,955
Some guys, I think, really think,
well, I'm coming, so they get, no.

61
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,324
They have stuff going on, as
you know, because you're waiting.

62
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,559
I'll tell you, in all
the tours I've ever

63
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,995
been to, the group
tours, there's always one.

64
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,698
That just can't get out of his own way.

65
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:17,237
And he's not having fun, and
he's miserable, and he's grumpy.

66
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:22,408
And I'll tell you, when it gets
that way, everybody avoids him.

67
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,676
The (Asian) girls avoid him.

68
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:24,677
The guys avoid him.

69
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:25,678
The (dating) tour avoids him.

70
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:28,381
Nobody wants to be around a negative Nancy.

71
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:28,848
No.

72
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:33,186
So the reality is, it didn't
go your way, okay, that's life.

73
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,787
Sometimes it's not going to go your way.

74
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:38,158
So you put a smile on your face, and
you go make something else happen.

75
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,960
I think what happens sometimes is
guys, they get a little discouraged.

76
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:44,063
Maybe it didn't work well, and
they just want someone to blame.

77
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,798
So they're going to blame the hotel.

78
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:46,733
They're going to blame us.

79
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,067
They're going to blame somebody.

80
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,903
Whereas if they just
kept positive and kept

81
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,771
going, it would have
turned out well for them.

82
00:02:56,142 --> 00:03:00,947
Alright, Max says, I don't know
how I feel about dating in a group.

83
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:05,518
I'd rather just video chat a girl
or two and then go meet them.

84
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:10,423
I mean, I'll say something
real quick and then you can

85
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,693
chime in, but I look, Max,
you can do whatever you like.

86
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,196
And certainly you can do that.
We have a lot of men that go over.

87
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,598
We call independently
and we will help set that up.

88
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,100
And we will arrange the meetings
when you get there. And that's wonderful.

89
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,837
But it's a long ways to go.
And even if you do a video call

90
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,675
with a (Asian) woman, you still, all
the senses are not in play yet.

91
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:32,312
It's not the same as meeting in
person. And to go all that way just

92
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:36,082
to meet one or two (Bangkok) women, if it
doesn't work, then you're coming back.

93
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,651
We have a gentleman right now
who I believe is in Eastern Europe,

94
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,421
went all the way to meet one
woman, didn't really work out very well.

95
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,691
He's coming back. That is a long
ways to go. Now we have also a (dating) tour

96
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:48,194
going there this week where they're
going to meet between the two socials.

97
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,763
It'll probably be about
250 to 300 (Asian) women that

98
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,333
they're going to get
the opportunity to meet.

99
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,702
You can still meet those
couple of women that you

100
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,137
want to video chat with.
You can make them priorities.

101
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,407
But why wouldn't you give
yourself every opportunity? I'm not

102
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,644
saying this to try to sell you
on something. I really don't care.

103
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,046
If you want to do the
group tour, that's wonderful.

104
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,982
If you want to go
individually, that's great too.

105
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,184
I'm just trying to give
you the benefit of my

106
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,853
experience over the last
30 years. And more is better.

107
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:17,557
More possibility is better.
When you have a limited amount

108
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,194
of time and you have to go
a long ways to accomplish it,

109
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,429
why wouldn't you give
yourself every opportunity?

110
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,266
And that's what I said. We kind
of talked about that a little earlier.

111
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,002
I think you ought to go
to the first two (speed dating) socials.

112
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:32,672
It's focused more on not who you're
interested in, but who's interested in you.

113
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,608
You're going to get 10
different tables. You're going to

114
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,344
pick one and try and find
one or two (Thai) girls at each table.

115
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:41,347
At the end of the day, you want
to have three or four or five girls

116
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,450
that you would be interested in
dating, should have pursued that way.

117
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,754
And then at the end of the
two socials, you have, what,

118
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,456
five to 10 girls that are
really interested in you.

119
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,626
And if you want to go do the
one where you just video chat

120
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,663
and do it, you may end up
finding yourself in that position.

121
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,464
If it doesn't work out. I did.

122
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,233
Yeah. I mean, you just don't know.

123
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,903
Two (Thai) girls I had that I was
settled on and I should have met

124
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:07,273
more and paid more attention
to who was interested in me.

125
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:09,742
But they ended up with
 at the same time.

126
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:13,646
And I had a week to two weeks in there
where I'm twiddling my thumbs thinking,

127
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:17,317
you know, every night at Hillary 11,
watching the band sing is kind of fun.

128
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,520
But it's not as fun as being on a
date with someone you're in love with.
