1
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:09,426
Okay, hold on, don't shoot.

2
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,928
- You see where you're going?
- Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,096
Okay.

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,181
Now, let's worry about how you get there.

5
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,434
Gotta move your foot here.

6
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:19,352
Point your toe this way.

7
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,271
Your hips here.

8
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:22,814
Okay?

9
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:24,941
- Can you see?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,109
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

11
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,610
How about now? Can you see now?

12
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,070
- No.
- How about now?

13
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,323
All right.

14
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,993
Ready? Three fingers.

15
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,870
Nice!

16
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,956
Nice throw, kiddo.

17
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,207
Here you go.

18
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,626
Hey, you guys want mayo?
Or mustard?

19
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,253
Or both?

20
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,505
Who puts mayo on a hot dog?

21
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:48,672
Probably your brothers.

22
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,967
Two mustard, please!
Thanks, Mama.

23
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,134
Got it!

24
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,054
Nate, mayo or mustard?

25
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,889
How about ketchup?

26
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,266
Or ketchup. I got ketchup, too.

27
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,642
Mind your elbow.

28
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:03,688
Good job, hawk-eye.

29
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,482
Go get your arrow.

30
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:09,694
Hey, guys!

31
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,072
Enough practice. Soup's on!

32
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,281
All right.

33
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,824
We're coming. We're hungry.

34
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,369
Lila, let's go.

35
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,664
Lila?

36
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,585
Honey?

37
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,632
Hey, babe?

38
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,518
Babe?

39
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,771
Babe?

40
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,649
Boys!

41
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:50,567
Boys!

42
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:53,905
Laura!

43
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:38,950
You don't need to do that.

44
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,162
Because you're just holding the position.

45
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,372
Oh, yeah.

46
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,665
That was close.

47
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,294
That's a goal.
We are now one apiece.

48
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:50,837
I would like to try again.

49
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,550
We're tied up. Feel the tension?

50
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,260
It's fun.

51
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,429
That was terrible.
Now you have a chance to win.

52
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,681
And you've won.

53
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:03,933
Congratulations.

54
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,226
Fair game.

55
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:07,937
Good sport.

56
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,315
You have fun?

57
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,069
It was fun.

58
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,218
This thing on?

59
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,389
Hey, Miss Potts. Pep.

60
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,434
If you find this recording...

61
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,270
don't post it on social media.

62
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,147
It's gonna be a real tearjerker.

63
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,234
I don't know if you're
ever gonna see these.

64
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,444
I don't even know if you're still...

65
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,863
Oh, God, I hope so.

66
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,950
Today's day 21.

67
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,369
No, 22.

68
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,580
You know, if it wasn't for the
existential terror...

69
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:12,210
of staring into the literal void of space,
I'd say I'm feeling a little better today.

70
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,422
Infection's run its course,
thanks to the Blue Meanie back there.

71
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,590
You'd love her.

72
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,175
Very practical.

73
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,720
Only a tiny bit sadistic.

74
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,810
So, the fuel cells
were cracked during battle...

75
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,146
and we figured out a way
to reverse the ion charge...

76
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,024
and bought ourselves
about 48 hours of flight time.

77
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,154
But it's now dead in the water.

78
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,824
Thousand light years
from the nearest 7-Eleven.

79
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,703
Oxygen will run out tomorrow morning...

80
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,873
and that'll be it.

81
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,254
Pep, I know I said no more surprises...

82
00:04:56,421 --> 00:05:00,008
but I got to say I was really
hoping to pull off one last one.

83
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,135
But it looks like...

84
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,095
Well, you know what it looks like.

85
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,349
Don't feel bad about this.

86
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,310
I mean, actually,
if you grovel for a couple weeks...

87
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:14,189
and then move on with enormous guilt...

88
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,365
I should probably lie down for a minute.
Go rest my eyes.

89
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,911
Please know...

90
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,707
when I drift off,
it'll be like every night lately.

91
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,877
I'm fine. Totally fine.

92
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,837
I dream about you.

93
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,007
Because it's always you.

94
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:04,753
Couldn't stop him.

95
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,920
Neither could I.

96
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,255
Hang on.

97
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,259
I lost the kid.

98
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,388
Tony, we lost.

99
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,683
Is...?

100
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,311
- Oh, good.
- Oh, my God!

101
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,355
Oh, my God!

102
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,487
It's okay.

103
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,204
It's been 23 days
since Thanos came to Earth.

104
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,917
World governments are in pieces.

105
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,002
The parts that are still working...

106
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,964
are trying to take a census
and it looks like he did...

107
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,445
He did exactly what he
said he was gonna do.

108
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,637
Thanos wiped out...

109
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,142
50% of all living creatures.

110
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,399
Where is he now? Where?

111
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,275
We don't know.

112
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,529
He just opened a portal and walked through.

113
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,199
What's wrong with him?

114
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,244
He's pissed.

115
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,745
He thinks he failed.

116
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,285
Which, of course, he did...

117
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,500
but there's a lot of that
going around, ain't there?

118
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,347
Honestly, until this exact second
I thought you were a Build-A-Bear.

119
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,796
Maybe I am.

120
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,482
We've been hunting Thanos
for three weeks now.

121
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,508
Deep space scans...

122
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,719
and satellites,
and we got nothing.

123
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:38,513
Tony, you fought him.

124
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,680
Who told you that?

125
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,307
I didn't fight him.

126
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,059
No, he wiped my face with a planet...

127
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,645
while the Bleecker Street magician
gave away the store.

128
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,290
That's what happened. There was no
fight, 'cause he's not beatable.

129
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,026
Did he give you any clues,
any coordinates, anything?

130
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,530
I saw this coming a few years back.

131
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,337
I had a vision.
I didn't wanna believe it.

132
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,284
Thought I was dreaming.

133
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:00,594
Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus.

134
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,370
And I needed you.

135
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:03,580
As in, past tense.

136
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:07,000
That trumps what you need.
It's too late, buddy.

137
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,293
Sorry.

138
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,963
You know what I need?
I need a shave.

139
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,133
And I believe I remember
telling all youse...

140
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,300
Tony, Tony!

141
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:21,639
Alive and otherwise, that what we needed
was a suit of armor around the world.

142
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:25,435
Remember that? Whether it impacted
our precious freedoms or not.

143
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,811
That's what we needed.

144
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,205
Well, that didn't work out, did it?

145
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,647
I said we'd lose.

146
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,983
You said,
"We'll do that together, too."

147
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,610
And guess what, Cap?

148
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,070
We lost.

149
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,529
And you weren't there.

150
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,282
But that's what we do, right?

151
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,202
Our best work after the fact?
We're the "Avengers."

152
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,329
We're the "Avengers,"
not the "Pre-vengers."

153
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:45,497
- Okay.
- Right?

154
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,016
You made your point. Just sit down, okay?

155
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,142
Okay. No, no, here's my point.
You know what?

156
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,685
- She's great by the way.
- Tony, you're sick. Sit down.

157
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,336
We need you. You're new blood.

158
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,339
Bunch of tired old mules.
I got nothing for you, Cap.

159
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:55,799
I got no coordinates...

160
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,718
no clues, no strategies, no options.

161
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,595
Zero. Zip. Nada.

162
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,514
No trust, liar.

163
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,311
Here, take this.

164
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,605
You find him, you put that on...

165
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,607
you hide.

166
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,610
- Tony!
- I'm fine.

167
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,487
Let me...

168
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,286
Bruce gave him a sedative.

169
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,453
He's gonna probably be out
for the rest of the day.

170
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,708
You guys take care of him...

171
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,954
and I'll bring him a Xorrian elixir
when I come back.

172
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,003
Where are you going?

173
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,838
To kill Thanos.

174
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,009
Hey.

175
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,302
You know, we usually work as a team here...

176
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,280
and, between you and I,
morale's a little fragile.

177
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,891
We realize up there is more your territory,
but this is our fight, too.

178
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,226
You even know where he is?

179
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,561
I know people who might.

180
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,062
Don't bother.

181
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,773
I can tell you where Thanos is.

182
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,279
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

183
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:03,950
And when he worked,
he talked about his Great Plan.

184
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,203
Even disassembled,
I wanted to please him.

185
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,788
I'd ask...

186
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,000
where would we go
once his plan was complete?

187
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,502
And his answer was always the same.

188
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:19,716
"To the Garden."

189
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,094
That's cute.
Thanos has a retirement plan.

190
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,804
So, where is he?

191
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,223
When Thanos snapped his fingers...

192
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,269
Earth became ground zero for a power surge
of ridiculously cosmic proportions.

193
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,646
No one's ever seen anything like it.

194
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,148
Until two days ago...

195
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,568
on this planet.

196
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,779
Thanos is there.

197
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,199
He used the stones again.

198
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,867
Hey, hey, hey.

199
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,244
We'd be going in shorthanded, you know?

200
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,930
Look, he's still got the stones, so...

201
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,498
So, let's get 'em.

202
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,041
Use them to bring everyone back.

203
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,292
Just like that?

204
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,044
Yeah. Just like that.

205
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:59,381
Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...

206
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,258
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.

207
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:06,388
If we do this, how do we know it's gonna
end any differently than it did before?

208
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,181
Because before you didn't have me.

209
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,225
Hey, new girl?

210
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:13,103
Everybody in this room
is about that superhero life.

211
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,040
And if you don't mind my asking,
where the hell have you been all this time?

212
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,483
There are a lot of other planets
in the universe.

213
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,528
And unfortunately,
they didn't have you guys.

214
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,258
I like this one.

215
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,265
Let's go get this son of a bitch.

216
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,038
Okay.

217
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,832
Who here hasn't been to space?

218
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,335
Why?

219
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,170
You better not throw up on my ship.

220
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:21,629
Approaching jump in three...

221
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,882
two, one.

222
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,147
I'll head down for recon.

223
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,875
This is gonna work, Steve.

224
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,835
I know it will.

225
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,966
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do
if it doesn't.

226
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,054
No satellites. No ships. No armies.

227
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,722
No ground defenses of any kind.

228
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,476
It's just him.

229
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,853
And that's enough.

230
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,319
Oh, no.

231
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:00,538
Where are they?

232
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:02,374
Answer the question.

233
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,212
The universe required correction.

234
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:11,174
After that, the stones served no purpose...

235
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,967
beyond temptation.

236
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,095
You murdered trillions!

237
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,639
You should be grateful.

238
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,770
Where are the stones?

239
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,313
Gone.

240
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,564
Reduced to atoms.

241
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:28,733
You used them two days ago!

242
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,112
I used the stones to destroy the stones.

243
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,489
It nearly killed me.

244
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,659
But the work is done.

245
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,745
It always will be.

246
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,709
I am inevitable.

247
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:50,380
We have to tear this place apart.
He has to be lying!

248
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:51,756
My father is many things.

249
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,718
A liar is not one of them.

250
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:00,056
Thank you, daughter.

251
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,853
Perhaps I treated you too harshly.

252
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,360
What?

253
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:14,779
What did you do?

254
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,116
I went for the head.

255
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,189
So...

256
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:34,984
I went on a date the other day.

257
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,820
It's the first time in five years.

258
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,322
You know?
I'm sitting there at dinner.

259
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,534
I didn't even know what to talk about.

260
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,078
What did you talk about?

261
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,915
Same old crap.
You know, how things have changed.

262
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,167
My job, his job.

263
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,045
How much we miss the Mets.

264
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,008
And then things got quiet...

265
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:03,722
then he cried
as they were serving the salads.

266
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,390
What about you?

267
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:09,728
I cried just before dessert.

268
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,608
But I'm seeing him again tomorrow, so...

269
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:17,527
That's great.

270
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,414
You did the hardest part.
You took the jump.

271
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,573
You didn't know where you
were gonna come down.

272
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:26,494
And that's it. That's those little
brave baby steps we got to take...

273
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:30,373
to try and become whole again,
try and find purpose.

274
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:36,212
I went in the ice in '45,
right after I met the love of my life.

275
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,840
Woke up 70 years later.

276
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,012
You got to move on.

277
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,350
Gotta move on.

278
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,607
The world is in our hands.

279
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:57,859
It's left to us, guys.

280
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,236
And we got to do something with it.

281
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,364
Otherwise...

282
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,992
Thanos should've killed all of us.

283
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:09,264
What the hell?

284
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:22,902
Hope?

285
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,103
Kid!

286
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,313
Hey, kid!

287
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,861
What the hell happened here?

288
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,311
Oh, my God!

289
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,607
Oh, please!

290
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:44,317
Please, please!

291
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,486
No, no, no. No.

292
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:49,322
No.

293
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:52,659
Excuse me. Sorry.

294
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:54,119
Cassie, no.

295
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:55,745
No, no, no.

296
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,832
No, no.

297
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:02,669
Please, please, please.
No, Cassie.

298
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:11,052
What?

299
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:42,459
Cassie?

300
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,003
Dad?

301
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:12,781
You're so big!

302
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:31,257
Yeah. We boarded that highly-suspect
warship Danvers pinged.

303
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,134
It was an infectious garbage scow.

304
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:34,761
So, thanks for the hot tip.

305
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:36,262
Well, you were closer.

306
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:37,865
Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.

307
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:39,289
You get a reading on those tremors?

308
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:41,976
'Twas a mild subduction
under the African plate.

309
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:44,187
Do we have a visual?
How are we handling it?

310
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:45,522
Nat.

311
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,941
It's an earthquake under the ocean.

312
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:50,944
We handle it by not handling it.

313
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:53,822
Carol, are we seeing you here next month?

314
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,991
- Not likely.
- What? You gonna get another haircut?

315
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:58,493
Listen, fur face.

316
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,453
I'm covering a lot of territory.

317
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,748
The things that are happening on Earth
are happening everywhere.

318
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:05,917
On thousands of planets.

319
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:08,753
All right, all right. That's a good point.
That's a good point.

320
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,006
So, you might not see me for a long time.

321
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,508
All right. Well...

322
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:16,511
This channel's always active.

323
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:18,763
So, if anything goes sideways...

324
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,349
anyone's making trouble
where they shouldn't...

325
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:22,684
comes through me.

326
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:24,310
Okay.

327
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:25,937
All right.

328
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:27,772
Good luck.

329
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:37,365
Where are you?

330
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:38,533
Mexico.

331
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,327
The Federales found a room full of bodies.

332
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:43,121
Looks like a bunch of cartel guys...

333
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:45,248
never even had a chance
to get their guns off.

334
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:47,125
It's probably a rival gang.

335
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:48,501
Except it isn't.

336
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:50,837
It's definitely Barton.

337
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,006
What he's done here...

338
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:56,343
what he's been doing
for the last few years...

339
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:58,970
I mean, the scene that he left...

340
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:03,516
I got to tell you, there's a part of me
that doesn't even wanna find him.

341
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:11,358
Will you find out where he's going next?

342
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:16,404
Nat?

343
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:19,908
Please?

344
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:22,827
Okay.

345
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:33,463
You know, I'd offer to cook you dinner...

346
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:35,382
but you seem pretty miserable already.

347
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:40,887
You here to do your laundry?

348
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,639
And to see a friend.

349
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:46,393
Clearly, your friend is fine.

350
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:51,745
You know, I saw a pod of whales
when I was coming over the bridge.

351
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:53,650
- In the Hudson?
- There's fewer ships...

352
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:55,068
cleaner water.

353
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:59,155
You know, if you're about to tell me
to look on the bright side...

354
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:05,120
I'm about to hit you in the head
with a peanut butter sandwich.

355
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,248
Sorry.

356
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:09,582
Force of habit.

357
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:26,975
You know, I keep telling everybody
they should move on...

358
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:28,810
and grow.

359
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,312
Some do.

360
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:36,276
But not us.

361
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:39,070
If I move on, who does this?

362
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:41,573
Maybe it doesn't need to be done.

363
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:48,038
I used to have nothing.

364
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,124
And then I got this.

365
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:55,128
This job.

366
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:59,257
This family.

367
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:06,931
And I was better because of it.

368
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:16,733
And even though they're gone...

369
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:23,114
I'm still trying to be better.

370
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,578
I think we both need to get a life.

371
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:32,415
You first.

372
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:40,423
Hi, hi! Is anyone home?

373
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,300
This is Scott Lang.

374
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:45,303
We met a few years ago at the airport...

375
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,138
in Germany?

376
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:49,599
I was the guy that got really big.
I had a mask on.

377
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,410
- You wouldn't recognize me.
- Is this an old message?

378
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:54,396
Ant-Man? I know you know that.

379
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:57,148
- It's the front gate.
- I really need to talk to you guys.

380
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:04,489
Scott.

381
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:06,449
Are you okay?

382
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:07,617
Yeah.

383
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:11,788
Have either of you guys
ever studied quantum physics?

384
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:13,707
Only to make conversation.

385
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,418
All right, so...

386
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:19,504
five years ago, right before...

387
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:21,214
Thanos...

388
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:23,675
I was in a place called the quantum realm.

389
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:26,344
The quantum realm is like
its own microscopic universe.

390
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:28,638
To get in there,
you have to be incredibly small.

391
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:30,348
Hope. She's my...

392
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:34,144
She was my...

393
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:37,134
She was supposed to pull me out.

394
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,815
And then Thanos happened...

395
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:40,650
and I got stuck in there.

396
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:43,212
I'm sorry, that must have been
a very long five years.

397
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:44,571
Yeah, but that's just it.

398
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:45,905
It wasn't.

399
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:47,282
For me, it was five hours.

400
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:50,009
See, the rules of the quantum realm
aren't like they are up here.

401
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:51,578
Everything is unpredictable.

402
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:52,954
Is that anybody's sandwich?

403
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:54,372
I'm starving.

404
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:55,832
Scott.

405
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:57,292
What are you talking about?

406
00:31:58,293 --> 00:31:59,544
So...

407
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:02,088
what I'm saying is...

408
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:05,383
time works differently
in the quantum realm.

409
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,845
The only problem is right now
we don't have a way to navigate it.

410
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:10,013
But what if we did?

411
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:13,975
I can't stop thinking about it. What if
we could somehow control the chaos...

412
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:15,268
and we could navigate it?

413
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:16,936
What if there was a way...

414
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:19,898
that we could enter the quantum realm
at a certain point in time...

415
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:22,776
but then exit the quantum realm
at another point in time?

416
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:24,277
Like...

417
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:27,113
- Like before Thanos.
- Wait.

418
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,865
Are you talking about a time machine?

419
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:31,785
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

420
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:32,994
This is more like a...

421
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:36,956
Yeah. Like a time machine.

422
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:38,917
I know, it's crazy. It's crazy.

423
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:42,462
But I can't stop thinking about it.
There's got to be...

424
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:44,506
some way...

425
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:46,466
- It's crazy.
- Scott.

426
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:47,926
I get emails from a raccoon...

427
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:50,095
so nothing sounds crazy anymore.

428
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:52,931
So, who do we talk to about this?

429
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:12,117
Chow time!

430
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:15,620
Maguna.

431
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,521
Morgan H. Stark, you want some lunch?

432
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:24,796
- Define "lunch" or be disintegrated.
- Okay.

433
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:27,652
You should not be wearing that, okay?

434
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:30,343
That is part of a special anniversary gift
I'm making for Mom.

435
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:36,683
There you go.
You thinking about lunch?

436
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,911
I can give you a handful of crickets
on a bed of lettuce.

437
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:40,645
- No.
- That's what you want.

438
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:42,939
How did you find this?

439
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:44,941
- Garage.
- Really?

440
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:47,110
- Were you looking for it?
- No.

441
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:49,863
I found it, though.

442
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,781
You like going in the garage, huh?

443
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:53,199
So does Daddy.

444
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,786
It's fine, actually.
Mom never wears anything I buy her.

445
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:00,749
So, I'm gonna...

446
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:20,810
No. We know what it sounds like.

447
00:34:20,977 --> 00:34:22,788
Tony, after everything you've seen,
is anything really impossible?

448
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:25,315
Quantum fluctuation
messes with the Planck Scale...

449
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:28,276
which then triggers the Deutsch
Proposition. Can we agree on that?

450
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:29,527
Thank you.

451
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:31,821
In layman's terms,
it means you're not coming home.

452
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:33,406
- I did.
- No.

453
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:34,991
You accidentally survived.

454
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:37,702
It's a billion-to-one cosmic fluke.

455
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:40,955
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

456
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:44,334
A time heist?

457
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:47,837
Yeah, a time heist. Of course.
Why didn't we think of this before?

458
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:50,465
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

459
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:54,219
The stones are in the past.
We could go back, we could get them.

460
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:56,680
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

461
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:58,765
Or screw it up
worse than he already has, right?

462
00:34:58,932 --> 00:34:59,933
I don't believe we would.

463
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:03,061
Gotta say it.
I sometimes miss that giddy optimism.

464
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:05,647
However, high hopes won't help...

465
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:11,319
if there's no logical, tangible way
for me to safely execute said time heist.

466
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:14,322
I believe the most likely outcome
will be our collective demise.

467
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:17,367
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

468
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:20,120
All right? It means no talking
to our past selves...

469
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:21,830
no betting on sporting events.

470
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:23,748
I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott.

471
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:27,919
Are you seriously telling me
that your plan to save the universe...

472
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:29,754
is based on Back to the Future?

473
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,632
- Is it?
- No.

474
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,111
Good. You had me worried there.
'Cause that would be horseshit.

475
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:37,429
That's not how quantum physics works.

476
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:38,763
Tony.

477
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:42,183
We have to take a stand.

478
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:44,728
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

479
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:48,383
I know you got a lot on the line.

480
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:51,401
You got a wife, a daughter.

481
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:54,070
But I lost someone very important to me.

482
00:35:54,237 --> 00:35:55,822
A lotta people did.

483
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:58,992
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

484
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:01,839
to bring everyone back, and you're
telling me that you won't even...

485
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:03,788
That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

486
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:06,833
I can't.

487
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:11,254
Mommy told me to come and save you.

488
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:13,840
Good job. I'm saved.

489
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:17,761
I wish you were coming here to ask me
something else. Anything else.

490
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:19,721
I'm honestly happy to see you guys,
I just...

491
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:21,608
- Oh, look, the table's set for six.
- Tony.

492
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:22,766
I get it.

493
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:25,226
And I'm happy for you. I really am.

494
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:27,520
But this is a second chance.

495
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:30,648
I got my second chance right here, Cap.

496
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:32,359
Can't roll the dice on it.

497
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:36,363
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

498
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:40,825
Well, he's scared.

499
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:42,535
He's not wrong.

500
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:44,704
Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

501
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:46,351
We need him. What, are we gonna stop?

502
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:49,084
No, I wanna do it right.

503
00:36:52,295 --> 00:36:53,963
We're gonna need a really big brain.

504
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:56,466
Bigger than his?

505
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:59,605
Come on, I feel like I'm the only one
eating here. Try some of that.

506
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:00,720
Have some eggs.

507
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:02,472
I'm so confused.

508
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,307
These are confusing times.

509
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:06,393
Right, no, no. That's not what I meant.

510
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:09,062
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

511
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:11,439
I know, it's crazy.

512
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:12,816
I'm wearing shirts now.

513
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:15,819
Yeah. What? How? Why?

514
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:18,613
Five years ago, we got our asses beat.

515
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,865
Except it was worse for me...

516
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:22,242
'cause I lost twice.

517
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,202
First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost...

518
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:26,329
and then, we all lost.

519
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:27,747
No one blamed you, Bruce.

520
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:29,290
I did.

521
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:33,562
For years, I've been treating the Hulk
like he's some kind of disease...

522
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:35,046
something to get rid of.

523
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:38,466
But then,
I start looking at him as the cure.

524
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,177
Eighteen months in the gamma lab.

525
00:37:41,344 --> 00:37:43,930
I put the brains and the brawn together...

526
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:45,348
and now, look at me.

527
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:47,726
Best of both worlds.

528
00:37:48,476 --> 00:37:49,811
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes.

529
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:51,312
Can we get a photo?

530
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,732
100%, little person.

531
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:55,942
Come on, step on up.
Do you mind?

532
00:37:56,651 --> 00:37:58,319
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Thanks.

533
00:37:58,486 --> 00:38:00,071
Say "green."

534
00:38:00,238 --> 00:38:02,490
- Green.
- Green.

535
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:03,657
Did you get that?

536
00:38:03,742 --> 00:38:04,993
That's a good one.

537
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:08,038
Did you want to grab one with me?
I'm Ant-Man.

538
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:13,626
They're Hulk fans. They don't know Ant-Man.

539
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:14,878
Nobody does.

540
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:16,731
- No, he wants you to take a picture with him.
- I don't want a picture.

541
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:17,756
Stranger danger.

542
00:38:17,922 --> 00:38:19,608
Yeah, look, he's even saying
no, he doesn't.

543
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:21,819
- I get it. I don't want it, either.
- But come on. The kid...

544
00:38:21,843 --> 00:38:23,261
I don't want a picture with them.

545
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:24,572
- He's gonna feel bad.
- Sorry.

546
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:25,906
They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.

547
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,490
- I don't want to do it.
- We can do it.

548
00:38:27,557 --> 00:38:29,559
- No, you feel bad.
- Take the goddamn phone.

549
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:30,894
Okay.

550
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:34,031
- Thank you, Mr. Hulk.
- No, it was great, kids. Thank you very much.

551
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:35,565
Hulk out!

552
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:36,732
Bruce.

553
00:38:37,192 --> 00:38:38,193
Dab.

554
00:38:38,526 --> 00:38:40,153
- Bruce.
- Listen to your mom.

555
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:41,529
She knows better.

556
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:43,365
About what we were saying.

557
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:44,741
Right.

558
00:38:46,701 --> 00:38:49,371
The whole time travel do-over?

559
00:38:50,663 --> 00:38:54,417
Guys, it's outside of my area of expertise.

560
00:38:54,876 --> 00:38:56,127
Well, you pulled this off.

561
00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:00,965
I remember a time when that seemed
pretty impossible, too.

562
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:37,085
I've got a mild inspiration.
I'd like to see if it checks out.

563
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:41,006
So, I'd like to run one last sim
before we pack it in for the night.

564
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:45,552
This time, in the shape of a Mobius strip,
inverted, please.

565
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,803
Processing.

566
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:52,767
Right, give me the eigenvalue
of that particle...

567
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:54,936
factoring in spectral decomp.

568
00:39:55,103 --> 00:39:57,063
- That'll take a second.
- Just a moment.

569
00:39:58,106 --> 00:40:00,984
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out.
I'm just kinda...

570
00:40:02,527 --> 00:40:04,029
Model rendered.

571
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:16,832
Shit!

572
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:18,167
Shit!

573
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:24,174
What are you doing up, little miss?

574
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:26,051
- Shit.
- Nope. We don't say that.

575
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:27,427
Only Mommy says that word.

576
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:29,012
She coined it. It belongs to her.

577
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:30,179
Why are you up?

578
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:31,824
'Cause I've got some important shit
going on here!

579
00:40:31,848 --> 00:40:33,016
Why do you think?

580
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:36,144
No, I got something on my mind.
I got something on my mind.

581
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:37,854
Was it juice pops?

582
00:40:39,397 --> 00:40:40,607
Sure was.

583
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:43,777
That's extortion. That's a word.

584
00:40:43,943 --> 00:40:45,111
What kind you want?

585
00:40:45,278 --> 00:40:46,279
Great minds think alike.

586
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:48,281
Juice pops exactly...

587
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,576
was on my mind.

588
00:40:52,994 --> 00:40:54,120
You done? Yeah?

589
00:40:54,662 --> 00:40:55,872
Now you are.

590
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:57,624
Here. Wipe.

591
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:03,004
Good. That face goes there.

592
00:41:03,171 --> 00:41:04,422
Tell me a story.

593
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:06,174
A story.

594
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:08,468
Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed.
The end.

595
00:41:08,843 --> 00:41:10,220
That is a horrible story.

596
00:41:10,387 --> 00:41:12,138
Come on, that's your favorite story.

597
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:14,015
Love you tons.

598
00:41:16,017 --> 00:41:17,852
I love you 3,000.

599
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,105
Wow.

600
00:41:27,445 --> 00:41:30,323
3,000. That's crazy.

601
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:33,326
Go to bed or I'll sell all your toys.

602
00:41:34,536 --> 00:41:35,870
Night night.

603
00:41:36,037 --> 00:41:37,247
Not that it's a competition...

604
00:41:37,747 --> 00:41:39,666
but she loves me 3,000.

605
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:40,917
Does she, now?

606
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:44,129
You were somewhere in
the low 6 to 900 range.

607
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:51,678
Whatcha reading?

608
00:41:52,303 --> 00:41:53,763
Just a book on composting.

609
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:56,016
What's new with composting?

610
00:41:57,475 --> 00:41:59,519
- Interesting science...
- I figured it out.

611
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:01,604
By the way.

612
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,859
And, you know, just so we're
talking about the same thing...

613
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:07,485
Time travel.

614
00:42:08,153 --> 00:42:09,153
What?

615
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,200
Wow.

616
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:19,831
That's amazing...

617
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:21,916
and terrifying.

618
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,543
That's right.

619
00:42:30,842 --> 00:42:32,552
We got really lucky.

620
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:33,720
Yeah.

621
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:35,013
I know.

622
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,306
A lot of people didn't.

623
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:38,099
Nope. And I can't help everybody.

624
00:42:39,851 --> 00:42:41,186
Sorta seems like you can.

625
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:42,979
Not if I stop.

626
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:47,025
I can put a pin in it right now and stop.

627
00:42:47,817 --> 00:42:48,818
Tony...

628
00:42:49,527 --> 00:42:51,071
trying to get you to stop...

629
00:42:51,237 --> 00:42:53,865
has been one of the few failures
of my entire life.

630
00:42:58,161 --> 00:42:59,829
Something tells me...

631
00:43:01,122 --> 00:43:03,842
I should put it in a lockbox
and drop it to the bottom of the lake...

632
00:43:05,001 --> 00:43:06,211
and go to bed.

633
00:43:12,592 --> 00:43:14,636
But would you be able to rest?

634
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:22,686
Okay, here we go.
Time travel test number one.

635
00:43:22,852 --> 00:43:25,021
Scott, fire up...

636
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:27,107
the van thing.

637
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:30,443
Breakers are set.

638
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:32,445
Emergency generators are on standby.

639
00:43:32,612 --> 00:43:37,534
Good, because if we blow the grid, I
don't want to lose Tiny here in the 1950s.

640
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:38,535
Excuse me?

641
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:40,662
He's kidding.

642
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:42,789
You can't say things like that.

643
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:44,457
It was a bad joke.

644
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:47,459
You were kidding, right?

645
00:43:47,585 --> 00:43:50,714
I have no idea.
We're talking about time travel here.

646
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,133
Either it's all a joke,
or none of it is.

647
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:54,968
We're good!

648
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:56,469
Get your helmet on.

649
00:43:57,095 --> 00:43:58,888
Scott, I'm gonna send you back a week...

650
00:43:59,055 --> 00:44:02,267
let you walk around for an hour,
then bring you back in 10 seconds.

651
00:44:02,434 --> 00:44:03,435
Make sense?

652
00:44:04,102 --> 00:44:05,353
Perfectly not confusing.

653
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,480
Good luck, Scott. You got this.

654
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:12,068
You're right. I do, Captain America.

655
00:44:14,237 --> 00:44:15,572
On a count of three...

656
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:19,617
Three, two, one.

657
00:44:23,705 --> 00:44:24,705
Guys?

658
00:44:25,081 --> 00:44:26,875
This doesn't feel right.

659
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:27,876
What is this?

660
00:44:28,043 --> 00:44:28,877
- What's going on?
- Who is that?

661
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:29,878
- Hold on.
- Is that Scott?

662
00:44:30,045 --> 00:44:31,045
Yes, it's Scott.

663
00:44:33,798 --> 00:44:36,343
- What's going on, Bruce?
- Oh, my back!

664
00:44:36,509 --> 00:44:37,611
- What is this?
- Hold on a second.

665
00:44:37,635 --> 00:44:39,030
- Could I get a little space here?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

666
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:40,930
- Can you bring him back?
- I'm working on it.

667
00:44:47,979 --> 00:44:48,980
It's a baby.

668
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:50,690
- It's Scott.
- As a baby.

669
00:44:50,857 --> 00:44:52,233
- He'll grow.
- Bring Scott back.

670
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,919
When I say kill the power, kill the power.

671
00:44:53,943 --> 00:44:55,195
Oh, my God.

672
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:57,280
And... kill it!

673
00:45:01,701 --> 00:45:03,495
Somebody peed my pants.

674
00:45:03,661 --> 00:45:04,661
Oh, thank God.

675
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:07,999
But I don't know if it
was baby me or old me.

676
00:45:11,336 --> 00:45:13,296
Or just me me.

677
00:45:13,713 --> 00:45:14,923
Time travel!

678
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:19,678
What?

679
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:23,598
I see this as an absolute win.

680
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:10,562
Why the long face?

681
00:46:10,729 --> 00:46:12,480
Let me guess, he turned into a baby.

682
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:15,734
Among other things, yeah.
What are you doing here?

683
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,318
It's the EPR Paradox.

684
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,297
Instead of pushing Lang through time,
you might've wound up...

685
00:46:20,321 --> 00:46:21,740
pushing time through Lang.

686
00:46:21,906 --> 00:46:24,626
It's tricky, dangerous. Somebody
could have cautioned you against it.

687
00:46:24,743 --> 00:46:25,743
You did.

688
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:27,078
Oh, did I?

689
00:46:27,245 --> 00:46:28,913
Well, thank God I'm here.

690
00:46:29,706 --> 00:46:31,332
Regardless, I fixed it.

691
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:34,711
A fully functioning time-space GPS.

692
00:46:36,796 --> 00:46:38,048
I just want peace.

693
00:46:39,674 --> 00:46:42,385
Turns out resentment is corrosive,
and I hate it.

694
00:46:43,261 --> 00:46:44,637
Me, too.

695
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:49,351
We got a shot at getting these stones,
but I got to tell you my priorities.

696
00:46:49,517 --> 00:46:51,853
Bring back what we lost,
I hope, yes.

697
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,856
Keep what I found,
I have to, at all costs.

698
00:46:56,107 --> 00:46:58,693
And maybe not die trying.

699
00:46:58,860 --> 00:46:59,903
Would be nice.

700
00:47:02,364 --> 00:47:03,448
Sounds like a deal.

701
00:47:27,055 --> 00:47:28,056
Tony, I don't know.

702
00:47:28,223 --> 00:47:29,849
Why?

703
00:47:30,016 --> 00:47:31,810
He made it for you.

704
00:47:31,976 --> 00:47:35,563
Plus, honestly, I have to get it out of
the garage before Morgan takes it sledding.

705
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:42,237
Thank you, Tony.

706
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:44,781
Will you keep that a little quiet?

707
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:46,930
Didn't bring one for the whole team.

708
00:47:48,618 --> 00:47:51,913
We are getting the whole team, yeah?

709
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,832
We're working on that right now.

710
00:48:11,933 --> 00:48:12,976
Hey, Humie.

711
00:48:13,518 --> 00:48:15,311
Where's Big Green?

712
00:48:15,645 --> 00:48:17,689
The kitchen, I think.

713
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:20,150
That's awesome.

714
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,445
Rhodey, careful on re-entry.

715
00:48:23,611 --> 00:48:25,321
There's an idiot in the landing zone.

716
00:48:26,489 --> 00:48:27,615
Oh, God.

717
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:30,243
What's up, Regular-Sized Man?

718
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:25,382
Kind of a step down from the golden palaces
and the magic hammers and whatnot.

719
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:26,907
Hey, have a little compassion, pal.

720
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:29,010
First, they lost Asgard,
then half their people.

721
00:49:29,177 --> 00:49:30,863
They're probably just happy to have a home.

722
00:49:30,887 --> 00:49:32,597
You shouldn't have come.

723
00:49:34,683 --> 00:49:35,684
Valkyrie!

724
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:38,561
Great to see you, angry girl!

725
00:49:38,728 --> 00:49:40,939
I think I liked you better
either of the other ways.

726
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:43,983
- This is Rocket.
- How ya doing?

727
00:49:46,403 --> 00:49:47,404
He won't see you.

728
00:49:47,737 --> 00:49:48,780
It's that bad, huh?

729
00:49:48,947 --> 00:49:53,576
We only see him once a month
when he comes in for "supplies."

730
00:49:54,661 --> 00:49:55,787
It's that bad.

731
00:49:55,954 --> 00:49:56,955
Yeah.

732
00:50:09,467 --> 00:50:10,510
What the...?

733
00:50:13,972 --> 00:50:15,640
Something died in here!

734
00:50:16,725 --> 00:50:18,977
Hello? Thor!

735
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,187
Are you here about the cable?

736
00:50:21,938 --> 00:50:24,024
The Cinemax went out two weeks ago...

737
00:50:24,607 --> 00:50:27,360
and the sports are all kinda fuzzy
and whatnot.

738
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:29,112
Thor?

739
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:39,622
Boys! Oh, my God!

740
00:50:40,248 --> 00:50:43,001
Oh, my God, it's so good to see you!

741
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:45,754
Come here, cuddly little rascal.

742
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,505
Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.

743
00:50:48,548 --> 00:50:49,632
That's not necessary.

744
00:50:50,091 --> 00:50:52,761
Hulk, you know my friends
Miek and Korg, right?

745
00:50:52,927 --> 00:50:54,054
- Hey, boys!
- Hey, guys.

746
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:55,472
Long time no see.

747
00:50:55,638 --> 00:50:57,891
Beer's in the bucket.
Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi.

748
00:50:58,058 --> 00:50:59,768
No password, obviously.

749
00:51:00,852 --> 00:51:02,354
Thor, he's back.

750
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,190
That kid on the TV
just called me a dickhead again.

751
00:51:05,732 --> 00:51:06,775
Noobmaster.

752
00:51:06,941 --> 00:51:09,402
Yeah, NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead.

753
00:51:09,569 --> 00:51:10,737
I am sick of this.

754
00:51:11,654 --> 00:51:14,574
Noobmaster, hey, it's Thor again.
You know, the God of Thunder.

755
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:17,022
Listen, bud, if you don't
log off this game immediately...

756
00:51:17,077 --> 00:51:20,277
I am gonna fly over to your house, come
down to that basement you're hiding in...

757
00:51:20,372 --> 00:51:22,999
rip off your arms,
and shove them up your butt!

758
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:26,419
Oh, that's right, yes!
Go cry to your father, you little weasel.

759
00:51:27,128 --> 00:51:28,129
Thank you, Thor.

760
00:51:28,296 --> 00:51:29,774
Let me know if he bothers you again, okay?

761
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:31,007
Thank you very much. I will.

762
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,444
So, you guys want a drink?
What are we drinking?

763
00:51:33,468 --> 00:51:35,887
I've got beer, tequila,
all sorts of things.

764
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:40,183
Buddy.

765
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:41,350
You all right?

766
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:42,811
Yes, I'm fine. Why?

767
00:51:42,977 --> 00:51:44,097
Why, don't I look all right?

768
00:51:44,437 --> 00:51:45,855
You look like melted ice cream.

769
00:51:47,857 --> 00:51:49,943
So, what's up?
You just here for a hang, or what?

770
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,403
We need your help.

771
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,614
There might be a chance
we could fix everything.

772
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:56,116
What, like the cable?

773
00:51:56,282 --> 00:51:58,493
'Cause that's been driving me
bananas for weeks.

774
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,661
Like Thanos.

775
00:52:18,847 --> 00:52:21,683
Don't say that name.

776
00:52:22,851 --> 00:52:25,520
Yeah, we don't actually say that name
in here.

777
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:32,235
Please take your hand off me.

778
00:52:35,655 --> 00:52:38,700
Now, I know that guy...

779
00:52:39,617 --> 00:52:40,744
might scare you.

780
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:42,287
Why would I be...?

781
00:52:42,454 --> 00:52:45,623
Why would I be scared of that guy?

782
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:47,625
I'm the one who killed that guy, remember?

783
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,837
Anyone else here kill that guy?

784
00:52:54,257 --> 00:52:55,342
Nope.

785
00:52:55,884 --> 00:52:56,885
Didn't think so.

786
00:52:57,969 --> 00:53:02,223
Korg, why don't you tell everybody
who chopped Thanos' big head off?

787
00:53:02,766 --> 00:53:03,808
Stormbreaker?

788
00:53:03,975 --> 00:53:05,602
Who was swinging Stormbreaker?

789
00:53:09,689 --> 00:53:11,900
I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay?

790
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:13,068
I've been there myself.

791
00:53:13,234 --> 00:53:15,528
And you want to know
who helped me out of it?

792
00:53:15,695 --> 00:53:18,031
Was it Natasha?

793
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:20,367
It was you.

794
00:53:20,533 --> 00:53:22,494
You helped me.

795
00:53:23,703 --> 00:53:25,163
So, why don't you ask...

796
00:53:26,247 --> 00:53:28,583
the Asgardians down there...

797
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,460
how much my help is worth?

798
00:53:36,132 --> 00:53:37,592
The ones that are left, anyway.

799
00:53:38,134 --> 00:53:39,719
I think we could bring them back.

800
00:53:40,637 --> 00:53:41,638
Stop.

801
00:53:42,764 --> 00:53:43,848
Stop, okay?

802
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:47,519
I know you think I'm down here
wallowing in my own self-pity...

803
00:53:47,686 --> 00:53:50,230
waiting to be rescued and saved...

804
00:53:50,397 --> 00:53:52,482
but I'm fine, okay.
We're fine, aren't we?

805
00:53:52,649 --> 00:53:54,109
We're good here, mate.

806
00:53:54,275 --> 00:53:56,379
So, whatever it is that you're offering,
we're not into it.

807
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:57,904
Don't care. Couldn't care less.

808
00:53:58,071 --> 00:53:59,155
Goodbye.

809
00:54:02,534 --> 00:54:04,244
We need you, pal.

810
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:15,672
There's beer on the ship.

811
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:21,344
What kind?

812
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,443
It's him! He's after Akihiko!

813
00:55:03,178 --> 00:55:05,347
Why are you doing this?

814
00:55:06,973 --> 00:55:08,641
We never did anything to you!

815
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:10,268
You survived...

816
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,395
Half the planet didn't.

817
00:55:12,896 --> 00:55:14,314
They got Thanos.

818
00:55:14,898 --> 00:55:15,899
You get me...

819
00:55:21,154 --> 00:55:23,198
You're done hurting people.

820
00:55:24,282 --> 00:55:26,368
WE hurt people?

821
00:55:29,954 --> 00:55:30,954
You're crazy!

822
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:02,112
Wait! Help me!

823
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,073
I'll give you anything!

824
00:56:06,324 --> 00:56:07,450
What do you want?

825
00:56:07,617 --> 00:56:10,704
What I want you can't give me.

826
00:56:34,602 --> 00:56:35,770
You shouldn't be here.

827
00:56:38,481 --> 00:56:40,233
Neither should you.

828
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:47,699
I've got a job to do.

829
00:56:49,284 --> 00:56:50,910
Is that what you're calling this?

830
00:56:51,995 --> 00:56:54,414
Killing all these people
isn't gonna bring your family back.

831
00:57:00,253 --> 00:57:01,338
We found something.

832
00:57:03,006 --> 00:57:05,175
A chance, maybe.

833
00:57:08,511 --> 00:57:09,721
Don't.

834
00:57:10,638 --> 00:57:12,098
Don't what?

835
00:57:15,143 --> 00:57:16,603
Don't give me hope.

836
00:57:19,939 --> 00:57:22,400
I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.

837
00:57:43,963 --> 00:57:45,256
You're drifting left.

838
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,550
One side there, Lebowski.

839
00:57:50,762 --> 00:57:52,055
Ratchet, how's it going?

840
00:57:52,222 --> 00:57:53,223
It's Rocket.

841
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,934
Take it easy.
You're only a genius on Earth, pal.

842
00:58:00,855 --> 00:58:02,440
Time travel suit, not bad.

843
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,318
Hey, hey, hey! Easy! Easy!

844
00:58:05,485 --> 00:58:06,486
I'm being very careful.

845
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:08,071
No, you're being very Hulky.

846
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:09,238
I'm being careful.

847
00:58:09,322 --> 00:58:10,722
These are Pym Particles, all right?

848
00:58:10,865 --> 00:58:13,425
And ever since Hank Pym got snapped
out of existence, this is it.

849
00:58:13,535 --> 00:58:15,415
This is what we have.
We're not making any more.

850
00:58:15,453 --> 00:58:17,372
- Scott, calm down.
- Sorry.

851
00:58:17,706 --> 00:58:20,667
We've got enough for one round-trip each.
That's it.

852
00:58:20,834 --> 00:58:21,876
No do-overs.

853
00:58:22,919 --> 00:58:24,254
Plus two test runs.

854
00:58:28,425 --> 00:58:29,425
One test run.

855
00:58:30,593 --> 00:58:32,178
All right. I'm not ready for this.

856
00:58:32,345 --> 00:58:33,638
I'm game.

857
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:37,600
I'll do it.

858
00:58:38,226 --> 00:58:41,229
Clint, now you're gonna feel a little
discombobulated from the chronoshift.

859
00:58:41,396 --> 00:58:43,416
- Don't worry about that.
- Wait a second. Let me ask you something.

860
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,066
If we can do this, you know...

861
00:58:45,233 --> 00:58:47,569
go back in time,
why don't we just find baby Thanos?

862
00:58:47,736 --> 00:58:48,903
You know, and...

863
00:58:52,907 --> 00:58:54,784
- First of all, that's horrible.
- It's Thanos.

864
00:58:54,951 --> 00:58:57,245
And secondly,
time doesn't work that way.

865
00:58:57,412 --> 00:58:59,581
Changing the past doesn't
change the future.

866
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:02,459
Look, we go back, we get the stones
before Thanos gets them...

867
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:05,378
Thanos doesn't have the stones.
Problem solved.

868
00:59:05,545 --> 00:59:07,380
- Bingo.
- That's not how it works.

869
00:59:07,547 --> 00:59:09,817
- Well, that's what I heard.
- Wait, but who? Who told you that?

870
00:59:09,841 --> 00:59:11,634
Star Trek, Terminator, Timecop...

871
00:59:11,801 --> 00:59:13,386
- Time After Time.
- Quantum Leap.

872
00:59:13,553 --> 00:59:15,740
- Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time.
- Hot Tub Time Machine.

873
00:59:15,764 --> 00:59:18,141
Hot Tub Time Machine.
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.

874
00:59:18,308 --> 00:59:20,393
Basically, any movie
that deals with time travel.

875
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,395
Die Hard. No, that's not one.

876
00:59:22,562 --> 00:59:23,605
This is known.

877
00:59:23,772 --> 00:59:26,167
I don't know why everyone believes that,
but that isn't true.

878
00:59:26,191 --> 00:59:28,193
Think about it.
If you travel to the past...

879
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,695
that past becomes your future...

880
00:59:30,862 --> 00:59:33,823
and your former present
becomes the past...

881
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:36,618
which can't now be changed
by your new future.

882
00:59:36,785 --> 00:59:37,994
Exactly.

883
00:59:38,578 --> 00:59:41,456
So Back to the Future
is a bunch of bullshit?

884
00:59:45,377 --> 00:59:46,795
All right, Clint.

885
00:59:47,462 --> 00:59:50,507
We're going in three, two...

886
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:51,675
one.

887
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:05,373
Cooper?

888
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,083
Where are my headphones?

889
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:08,250
Lila?

890
01:01:08,335 --> 01:01:10,420
- I never had them.
- Lila?

891
01:01:11,254 --> 01:01:13,173
Yeah, you had them yesterday!

892
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:15,050
Lila! Lila!

893
01:01:20,555 --> 01:01:21,556
Yeah, Dad?

894
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:26,478
Dad?

895
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,273
Lila!

896
01:01:36,196 --> 01:01:38,531
Hey. Hey, look at me.

897
01:01:38,698 --> 01:01:39,824
You okay?

898
01:01:40,533 --> 01:01:42,577
Yeah. Yeah.

899
01:01:44,496 --> 01:01:45,663
It worked.

900
01:01:47,415 --> 01:01:48,792
It worked.

901
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,755
Okay, so the how works.

902
01:01:54,422 --> 01:01:57,467
Now, we got to figure out
the when and the where.

903
01:01:58,301 --> 01:02:00,237
Almost everyone in this room
has had an encounter...

904
01:02:00,261 --> 01:02:02,021
with at least one of
the six Infinity Stones.

905
01:02:02,097 --> 01:02:03,598
Or substitute the word "encounter"...

906
01:02:03,765 --> 01:02:06,351
for "damn near been killed"
by one of the six Infinity Stones.

907
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:07,686
Well, I haven't...

908
01:02:07,852 --> 01:02:10,252
but I don't even know
what the hell you're all talking about.

909
01:02:10,355 --> 01:02:15,110
Regardless, we only have enough
Pym Particles for one round-trip each.

910
01:02:15,276 --> 01:02:18,488
And these stones have been in a lot
of different places throughout history.

911
01:02:18,655 --> 01:02:19,948
Our history.

912
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:23,118
So, not a lot of convenient spots
to just drop in, yeah?

913
01:02:23,284 --> 01:02:25,078
Which means we have to pick our targets.

914
01:02:25,537 --> 01:02:26,788
Correct.

915
01:02:28,164 --> 01:02:29,749
So, let's start with the Aether.

916
01:02:29,916 --> 01:02:31,126
Thor, what do you know?

917
01:02:36,715 --> 01:02:37,924
Is he asleep?

918
01:02:38,091 --> 01:02:40,635
No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

919
01:02:44,055 --> 01:02:45,265
Where to start?

920
01:02:47,058 --> 01:02:49,602
The Aether, firstly, is not a stone.

921
01:02:50,061 --> 01:02:51,896
Someone called it a stone before.

922
01:02:53,648 --> 01:02:57,277
It's more of an angry sludge
sort of a thing...

923
01:02:57,444 --> 01:03:00,321
so someone's gonna need to amend that
and stop saying that.

924
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:03,324
Here's an interesting story, though,
about the Aether.

925
01:03:03,491 --> 01:03:05,368
My grandfather, many years ago...

926
01:03:05,535 --> 01:03:09,039
had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

927
01:03:10,957 --> 01:03:11,957
Scary beings.

928
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:13,793
So, Jane, actually...

929
01:03:14,377 --> 01:03:15,920
Oh, there she is.

930
01:03:16,379 --> 01:03:19,758
Yeah, so Jane was an old flame of mine.

931
01:03:20,925 --> 01:03:23,970
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

932
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:26,973
and then the Aether stuck itself
inside her...

933
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:29,184
and she became very, very sick.

934
01:03:29,351 --> 01:03:32,479
And so I had to take her to Asgard,
which is where I'm from...

935
01:03:32,645 --> 01:03:34,606
and we had to try and fix her.

936
01:03:34,773 --> 01:03:36,399
We were dating at the time, you see...

937
01:03:36,566 --> 01:03:39,944
and I got to introduce her to my mother...

938
01:03:41,488 --> 01:03:43,323
who's dead and...

939
01:03:44,741 --> 01:03:48,286
Oh, you know, Jane and I
aren't even dating anymore, so...

940
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:50,681
Yes, these things happen, though. You know?

941
01:03:50,705 --> 01:03:52,183
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

942
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:54,101
- Why don't you come sit down?
- I'm not done yet.

943
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:57,170
The only thing that is permanent
in life is impermanence.

944
01:03:57,921 --> 01:04:00,215
Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast?

945
01:04:00,382 --> 01:04:02,425
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

946
01:04:02,592 --> 01:04:04,719
Quill said he stole
the Power Stone from Morag.

947
01:04:05,637 --> 01:04:08,515
- Is that a person?
- No, Morag's a planet.

948
01:04:09,224 --> 01:04:10,600
Quill was a person.

949
01:04:11,351 --> 01:04:13,687
Like a planet?
Like in outer space?

950
01:04:13,853 --> 01:04:18,066
Oh, look. It's like a little puppy,
all happy and everything.

951
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:21,403
Do you wanna go to space?
You wanna go to space, puppy?

952
01:04:21,569 --> 01:04:22,696
I'll take you to space.

953
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:25,990
Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.

954
01:04:26,157 --> 01:04:28,118
What is Vormir?

955
01:04:28,284 --> 01:04:29,452
A dominion of death...

956
01:04:30,161 --> 01:04:32,038
at the very center of celestial existence.

957
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:37,961
It's where Thanos murdered my sister.

958
01:04:44,384 --> 01:04:45,427
Not it.

959
01:04:47,178 --> 01:04:48,805
- That Time Stone guy.
- Doctor Strange.

960
01:04:48,972 --> 01:04:50,765
Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?

961
01:04:50,932 --> 01:04:52,892
Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit-from-hat.

962
01:04:53,059 --> 01:04:54,419
Nice place in the Village, though.

963
01:04:54,519 --> 01:04:56,104
Yeah, on Sullivan Street?

964
01:04:56,271 --> 01:04:57,272
Bleecker Street.

965
01:04:57,439 --> 01:04:58,523
Wait, he lived in New York?

966
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:01,377
- No, he lived in Toronto.
- Yeah, on Bleecker and Sullivan.

967
01:05:01,401 --> 01:05:03,201
- Have you been listening to anything?
- Guys.

968
01:05:03,361 --> 01:05:06,906
If you pick the right year,
there are three stones in New York.

969
01:05:09,367 --> 01:05:11,077
Shut the front door.

970
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:15,957
All right. We have a plan.

971
01:05:16,124 --> 01:05:20,712
Six stones, three teams, one shot.

972
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:32,307
Five years ago, we lost.

973
01:05:33,641 --> 01:05:34,934
All of us.

974
01:05:36,853 --> 01:05:38,229
We lost friends.

975
01:05:38,938 --> 01:05:40,607
We lost family.

976
01:05:42,567 --> 01:05:44,402
We lost a part of ourselves.

977
01:05:45,862 --> 01:05:48,198
Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.

978
01:05:49,616 --> 01:05:52,452
You know your teams.
You know your missions.

979
01:05:53,286 --> 01:05:55,205
Get the stones. Get them back.

980
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:57,207
One round-trip each.

981
01:05:57,374 --> 01:05:58,458
No mistakes...

982
01:05:58,958 --> 01:06:00,669
no do-overs.

983
01:06:00,835 --> 01:06:02,712
Most of us are going somewhere we know.

984
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,759
That doesn't mean we should know
what to expect.

985
01:06:05,882 --> 01:06:06,883
Be careful.

986
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:08,802
Look out for each other.

987
01:06:10,261 --> 01:06:12,055
This is the fight of our lives...

988
01:06:12,931 --> 01:06:14,516
and we're gonna win.

989
01:06:16,685 --> 01:06:17,686
Whatever it takes.

990
01:06:20,939 --> 01:06:22,399
Good luck.

991
01:06:22,565 --> 01:06:23,650
He's pretty good at that.

992
01:06:23,817 --> 01:06:24,984
- Right?
- All right.

993
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:27,487
You heard the man.
Stroke those keys, Jolly Green.

994
01:06:28,446 --> 01:06:29,989
Trackers engaged.

995
01:06:30,782 --> 01:06:32,760
You promise to bring that back
in one piece, right?

996
01:06:32,784 --> 01:06:34,119
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

997
01:06:34,285 --> 01:06:36,162
Okay, I'll do my best.

998
01:06:36,329 --> 01:06:38,123
As promises go,
that was pretty lame.

999
01:06:41,209 --> 01:06:42,335
See ya in a minute.

1000
01:07:36,765 --> 01:07:38,200
All right, we all have our assignments.

1001
01:07:38,224 --> 01:07:40,435
Two stones uptown, one stone down.

1002
01:07:40,602 --> 01:07:42,562
Stay low. Keep an eye on the clock.

1003
01:07:57,994 --> 01:07:59,788
Maybe smash a few things along the way.

1004
01:08:00,914 --> 01:08:02,916
I think it's gratuitous,
but whatever.

1005
01:08:30,652 --> 01:08:33,822
I'd be careful going that way.
We just had the floors waxed.

1006
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,787
Yeah, I'm looking for Doctor Strange.

1007
01:08:42,372 --> 01:08:45,250
You're about five years too early.

1008
01:08:46,042 --> 01:08:49,754
Stephen Strange is currently performing
surgery about 20 blocks that way.

1009
01:08:51,548 --> 01:08:52,588
What do you want from him?

1010
01:08:53,466 --> 01:08:54,467
That, actually.

1011
01:08:57,846 --> 01:08:58,846
I'm afraid not.

1012
01:08:59,097 --> 01:09:00,473
Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

1013
01:09:01,391 --> 01:09:02,431
You don't want to do this.

1014
01:09:02,559 --> 01:09:04,286
You're right, I don't.
But I need that stone...

1015
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:05,812
and I don't have time to debate it.

1016
01:09:14,821 --> 01:09:16,406
Let's start over, shall we?

1017
01:09:27,959 --> 01:09:29,461
For you, Lady Jane.

1018
01:09:29,627 --> 01:09:32,005
Do you have anything with pants?

1019
01:09:32,172 --> 01:09:33,214
Pants?

1020
01:09:33,381 --> 01:09:35,467
Never mind. These will be fine.
Thank you.

1021
01:09:35,633 --> 01:09:37,260
- Yes, milady.
- There's Jane.

1022
01:09:38,887 --> 01:09:39,888
All right.

1023
01:09:41,473 --> 01:09:42,724
Here's the deal, tubby.

1024
01:09:42,891 --> 01:09:45,411
You're gonna charm her,
and I'm gonna poke her with this thing...

1025
01:09:45,435 --> 01:09:47,896
and extract the Reality Stone,
and get gone lickety-split.

1026
01:09:49,647 --> 01:09:52,609
I'll be right back, okay?
The wine cellar is just down here.

1027
01:09:52,776 --> 01:09:55,653
My father used to have this
huge barrel of Aakonian ale.

1028
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:57,214
I'll see if the scullery has a couple
of to-go cups.

1029
01:09:57,238 --> 01:09:59,115
Hey. Hey!
Aren't you drunk enough already?

1030
01:10:06,498 --> 01:10:08,458
- If you could send Loki some soup.
- Yes, milady.

1031
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:12,587
And ask our librarians to pull
some volumes from the astronomy shelf.

1032
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,303
Who's the fancy broad?

1033
01:10:21,638 --> 01:10:23,139
That's my mother.

1034
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,350
She dies today.

1035
01:10:26,017 --> 01:10:27,811
Oh, that is today?

1036
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:36,903
I can't do this. I can't do this.

1037
01:10:37,487 --> 01:10:39,167
I shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't have come.

1038
01:10:39,197 --> 01:10:40,323
It's a bad idea!

1039
01:10:40,615 --> 01:10:41,658
- Come here.
- No, no, no.

1040
01:10:41,825 --> 01:10:44,244
I think I'm having a panic attack.

1041
01:10:44,411 --> 01:10:46,771
- Come here. Right here.
- I shouldn't be here. This is bad.

1042
01:10:47,205 --> 01:10:48,974
You think you're the only one
who lost people?

1043
01:10:48,998 --> 01:10:50,834
What do you think we're doing here?

1044
01:10:51,001 --> 01:10:53,169
I lost the only family I ever had.

1045
01:10:53,336 --> 01:10:55,755
Quill, Groot, Drax,
the chick with the antenna...

1046
01:10:55,922 --> 01:10:57,340
all gone.

1047
01:10:58,049 --> 01:10:59,384
I get you miss your mom...

1048
01:10:59,676 --> 01:11:00,885
but she's gone.

1049
01:11:01,052 --> 01:11:02,053
Really gone.

1050
01:11:02,637 --> 01:11:05,473
And there are plenty of people
who are only kind of gone...

1051
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:06,766
and you can help them.

1052
01:11:07,892 --> 01:11:11,104
So, is it too much to ask that
you brush the crumbs out of your beard...

1053
01:11:11,271 --> 01:11:13,565
make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants...

1054
01:11:14,024 --> 01:11:16,901
and when she's not looking,
suck out the Infinity Stone...

1055
01:11:17,068 --> 01:11:18,653
and help me get my family back?

1056
01:11:20,321 --> 01:11:21,322
Okay.

1057
01:11:21,614 --> 01:11:22,615
Are you crying?

1058
01:11:23,533 --> 01:11:24,534
No.

1059
01:11:26,369 --> 01:11:27,537
Yes.

1060
01:11:27,704 --> 01:11:28,913
I feel like I'm losing it.

1061
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:30,081
Get it together!

1062
01:11:30,248 --> 01:11:31,249
You can do this.

1063
01:11:32,334 --> 01:11:33,752
You can do this.

1064
01:11:36,921 --> 01:11:37,922
All right?

1065
01:11:38,089 --> 01:11:39,090
Yes, I can.

1066
01:11:39,257 --> 01:11:40,258
Good.

1067
01:11:42,469 --> 01:11:44,804
I can do this. I can do this.

1068
01:11:45,638 --> 01:11:47,098
I can't do this.

1069
01:11:47,265 --> 01:11:50,685
All right, heartbreaker, she's alone.
This is our shot.

1070
01:11:50,852 --> 01:11:53,438
Thor? Thor!

1071
01:12:03,823 --> 01:12:05,075
All right, bring it down, Blue.

1072
01:12:05,241 --> 01:12:07,660
Right on that line. That's it.
Down, down.

1073
01:12:12,957 --> 01:12:14,000
Hey, can we hurry it up?

1074
01:12:14,167 --> 01:12:16,252
Guys, chop-chop. Come on.
We're on the clock.

1075
01:12:16,419 --> 01:12:18,171
All that is really helpful.

1076
01:12:20,382 --> 01:12:21,883
- Take care, okay?
- Yeah.

1077
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:24,511
Get that stone and come back.
No messing around.

1078
01:12:25,053 --> 01:12:26,721
- Hey.
- We got this.

1079
01:12:26,888 --> 01:12:28,128
- Let's get it done.
- Yes, sir.

1080
01:12:28,264 --> 01:12:29,557
I'll see you back.

1081
01:12:30,266 --> 01:12:31,601
You guys watch each other's six.

1082
01:12:32,268 --> 01:12:33,520
Yeah.

1083
01:12:42,195 --> 01:12:43,738
Coordinates for Vormir are laid in.

1084
01:12:45,365 --> 01:12:47,283
All they have to do is not fall out.

1085
01:12:53,206 --> 01:12:55,583
We're a long way from Budapest.

1086
01:13:00,463 --> 01:13:01,965
Okay, so...

1087
01:13:03,216 --> 01:13:06,428
we just wait around
for this Quill guy to show up...

1088
01:13:06,594 --> 01:13:08,634
and then he leads us
to the Power Stone, is that it?

1089
01:13:09,431 --> 01:13:10,849
Let's take cover.

1090
01:13:12,475 --> 01:13:14,936
We're not the only ones in 2014
looking for the stones.

1091
01:13:15,103 --> 01:13:16,497
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about right now?

1092
01:13:16,521 --> 01:13:18,001
Who else is looking for these stones?

1093
01:13:21,484 --> 01:13:22,902
My father...

1094
01:13:23,069 --> 01:13:24,863
my sister...

1095
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:26,156
and me.

1096
01:13:26,322 --> 01:13:27,490
And you?

1097
01:13:29,367 --> 01:13:30,952
Where are you right now?

1098
01:13:59,647 --> 01:14:00,815
You're welcome.

1099
01:14:00,982 --> 01:14:03,276
I didn't ask for your help.

1100
01:14:03,943 --> 01:14:05,570
And yet, you always need it.

1101
01:14:09,616 --> 01:14:11,618
Get up. Father wants us back on the ship.

1102
01:14:11,785 --> 01:14:12,786
Why?

1103
01:14:12,952 --> 01:14:14,954
He's found an Infinity Stone.

1104
01:14:19,417 --> 01:14:20,877
Where?

1105
01:14:21,044 --> 01:14:22,796
On a planet called Morag.

1106
01:14:24,422 --> 01:14:26,341
Father's plan is finally in motion.

1107
01:14:26,508 --> 01:14:28,510
One stone isn't six, Nebula.

1108
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:29,886
It's a start.

1109
01:14:30,053 --> 01:14:31,846
If he gets all of them...

1110
01:14:44,859 --> 01:14:48,405
Ronan's located the Power Stone.
I'm dispatching you to his ship.

1111
01:14:48,571 --> 01:14:49,781
He won't like that.

1112
01:14:49,948 --> 01:14:52,075
His alternative is death.

1113
01:14:53,576 --> 01:14:55,328
Ronan's obsession...

1114
01:14:56,371 --> 01:14:58,540
clouds his judgment.

1115
01:15:02,961 --> 01:15:04,754
We will not fail you, Father.

1116
01:15:05,797 --> 01:15:07,424
No, you won't.

1117
01:15:10,135 --> 01:15:11,136
I swear...

1118
01:15:13,013 --> 01:15:14,931
I will make you proud.

1119
01:15:23,314 --> 01:15:26,985
We just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up...

1120
01:15:27,152 --> 01:15:29,192
and then he leads us
to the Power Stone, is that it?

1121
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,905
Let's take cover.

1122
01:15:31,906 --> 01:15:34,784
We're not the only ones in 2014
looking for the stones.

1123
01:15:37,203 --> 01:15:38,663
Who was that?

1124
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:39,831
I don't know.

1125
01:15:39,998 --> 01:15:42,167
My head is splitting.
I don't know.

1126
01:15:43,626 --> 01:15:46,588
Her synaptic drive was
probably damaged in battle.

1127
01:15:56,848 --> 01:15:58,892
Bring her to my ship.

1128
01:16:06,524 --> 01:16:07,359
Better hustle, Cap.

1129
01:16:07,525 --> 01:16:09,611
Things look like they're
just about wrapped up here.

1130
01:16:09,778 --> 01:16:11,404
Got it.
I'm approaching the elevator now.

1131
01:16:17,869 --> 01:16:19,454
If it's all the same to you...

1132
01:16:21,748 --> 01:16:23,291
I'll have that drink now.

1133
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:25,293
All right, get him on his feet.

1134
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:28,463
We can all stand around
posing up a storm later.

1135
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:29,990
By the way, feel free to clean up.

1136
01:16:30,882 --> 01:16:33,134
Mr. Rogers, I almost forgot that
that suit...

1137
01:16:33,301 --> 01:16:35,220
did nothing for your ass.

1138
01:16:35,387 --> 01:16:36,627
No one asked you to look, Tony.

1139
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,600
- It's ridiculous.
- I think you look great, Cap.

1140
01:16:38,765 --> 01:16:41,267
As far as I'm concerned,
that's America's ass.

1141
01:16:41,476 --> 01:16:43,395
Who gets the magic wand?

1142
01:16:43,561 --> 01:16:45,161
S.T.R.I.K.E. team's coming to secure it.

1143
01:16:55,782 --> 01:16:57,534
We can take that off your hands.

1144
01:16:57,701 --> 01:16:58,702
By all means.

1145
01:17:00,954 --> 01:17:02,664
Careful with that thing.

1146
01:17:02,831 --> 01:17:04,391
Yeah, unless you want your mind erased.

1147
01:17:04,457 --> 01:17:05,458
And not in a fun way.

1148
01:17:05,625 --> 01:17:06,626
We promise to be careful.

1149
01:17:06,793 --> 01:17:07,794
Who are these guys?

1150
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:09,254
They are S.H.I.E.I.D.

1151
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:12,507
Well, actually Hydra,
but we didn't know that yet.

1152
01:17:12,674 --> 01:17:14,843
Seriously? You didn't?

1153
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:16,511
I mean, they look like bad guys.

1154
01:17:16,678 --> 01:17:18,198
You're small, but you're talking loud.

1155
01:17:18,263 --> 01:17:20,103
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1156
01:17:20,265 --> 01:17:22,225
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1157
01:17:22,392 --> 01:17:24,853
I mean, honestly,
how do you keep your food down?

1158
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:26,438
Shut up.

1159
01:17:27,022 --> 01:17:28,422
All right, you're up, little buddy.

1160
01:17:28,481 --> 01:17:30,608
There's our stone.

1161
01:17:30,775 --> 01:17:31,776
All right.

1162
01:17:31,943 --> 01:17:33,111
Flick me.

1163
01:17:47,208 --> 01:17:48,209
- Move.
- Hey.

1164
01:17:48,376 --> 01:17:50,128
Hey, hey. Buddy!

1165
01:17:50,295 --> 01:17:52,231
What do you think?
Maximum occupancy has been reached.

1166
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,256
Take the stairs.

1167
01:17:53,423 --> 01:17:55,300
Yeah. Stop, stop.

1168
01:17:58,053 --> 01:18:00,847
"Take the stairs." Hate the stairs.

1169
01:18:04,559 --> 01:18:06,936
All right, Cap, I got our scepter
in the elevator...

1170
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:08,897
just passing the 80th floor.

1171
01:18:09,689 --> 01:18:10,690
On it.

1172
01:18:11,524 --> 01:18:13,604
- Head to the lobby.
- All right, I'll see you there.

1173
01:18:13,777 --> 01:18:15,362
Evidence secure.

1174
01:18:15,528 --> 01:18:16,946
We're en route to Doctor List.

1175
01:18:17,655 --> 01:18:20,533
No. No hitches at all, Mr. Secretary.

1176
01:18:25,955 --> 01:18:26,706
Captain.

1177
01:18:26,873 --> 01:18:28,917
I thought you were
coordinating search and rescue.

1178
01:18:29,084 --> 01:18:30,627
Change of plans.

1179
01:18:34,464 --> 01:18:35,882
Hey, Cap.

1180
01:18:37,175 --> 01:18:38,218
Rumlow.

1181
01:18:44,516 --> 01:18:46,351
I just got a call from the secretary.

1182
01:18:46,518 --> 01:18:48,395
I'm gonna be running point on the scepter.

1183
01:18:50,897 --> 01:18:53,149
Sir? I don't understand.

1184
01:18:55,610 --> 01:18:57,490
We got word there may be
an attempt to steal it.

1185
01:18:57,612 --> 01:18:59,197
Sorry, Cap.

1186
01:18:59,364 --> 01:19:00,782
We can't give you the scepter.

1187
01:19:01,366 --> 01:19:03,243
I'm gonna have to call the director.

1188
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:05,537
That's okay. Trust me.

1189
01:19:09,124 --> 01:19:10,124
Hail Hydra.

1190
01:19:24,764 --> 01:19:26,641
So many stairs!

1191
01:19:38,361 --> 01:19:40,989
Thumbelina, do you copy?
I've got eyes on the prize.

1192
01:19:41,156 --> 01:19:42,240
It is go time.

1193
01:19:42,407 --> 01:19:43,408
Bombs away.

1194
01:19:50,665 --> 01:19:53,043
Is that Axe Body Spray?

1195
01:19:53,209 --> 01:19:55,420
Yeah, I had a can in the desk
for emergencies. Relax.

1196
01:19:55,587 --> 01:19:56,671
Can we focus, please?

1197
01:19:56,838 --> 01:19:58,089
I'm going inside you...

1198
01:19:58,798 --> 01:19:59,799
now.

1199
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,140
May I ask you where you're going?

1200
01:20:07,307 --> 01:20:09,559
Bit of lunch and then Asgard.
I'm sorry, you are...?

1201
01:20:09,726 --> 01:20:10,727
Alexander Pierce.

1202
01:20:10,894 --> 01:20:13,355
He's the man above the folks
behind Nick Fury.

1203
01:20:13,521 --> 01:20:14,790
My friends call me Mr. Secretary.

1204
01:20:14,814 --> 01:20:17,192
I'm gonna have to ask you to turn
that prisoner over to me.

1205
01:20:17,609 --> 01:20:19,169
Loki will be answering to Odin himself.

1206
01:20:19,319 --> 01:20:21,696
No, he's going to answer to us.
Odin can have what's left.

1207
01:20:21,863 --> 01:20:23,323
And I'm gonna need that case.

1208
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:25,426
That's been S.H.I.E.I.D. property
for over 70 years.

1209
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:26,659
Hand over the case, Stark.

1210
01:20:26,826 --> 01:20:29,347
All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things
are getting dicey out here. Let's go.

1211
01:20:29,371 --> 01:20:31,515
I'm not gonna argue who's got
the higher authority here...

1212
01:20:31,539 --> 01:20:32,832
You promise me you won't die?

1213
01:20:32,999 --> 01:20:35,710
We're only giving me
a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

1214
01:20:35,877 --> 01:20:37,462
That doesn't sound mild.

1215
01:20:37,629 --> 01:20:38,630
I need the case.

1216
01:20:38,797 --> 01:20:40,316
I know you got a lot of pull,
I'm just saying, jurisdiction...

1217
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:41,508
Okay, then give me the case.

1218
01:20:41,675 --> 01:20:43,718
- Well, jurisdiction...
- Hand it over.

1219
01:20:43,885 --> 01:20:44,885
Do it, Lang!

1220
01:20:44,969 --> 01:20:47,209
- Get your hands off me.
- Window's closing. Pull my pin.

1221
01:20:47,931 --> 01:20:49,182
Here goes!

1222
01:20:52,018 --> 01:20:53,561
- Stark?
- Stark?

1223
01:20:54,896 --> 01:20:56,096
He's convulsing. Give him air!

1224
01:20:56,147 --> 01:20:57,857
- Medic!
- Medic!

1225
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,776
Give these guys some help.

1226
01:21:00,151 --> 01:21:01,152
Speak to me.

1227
01:21:01,611 --> 01:21:03,405
Stark, is it your chest machine?

1228
01:21:06,157 --> 01:21:07,492
Breathe, breathe.

1229
01:21:12,747 --> 01:21:15,147
Good job. Meet me in the alley.
I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

1230
01:21:20,797 --> 01:21:22,507
No stairs!

1231
01:21:30,724 --> 01:21:32,142
Come on, Stark, stay with us.

1232
01:21:32,308 --> 01:21:35,108
I'm going to try something. Okay?
I have no idea if it's going to work.

1233
01:21:36,271 --> 01:21:37,271
Yes!

1234
01:21:37,313 --> 01:21:38,690
Oh, that worked a treat.

1235
01:21:38,857 --> 01:21:39,858
Dude, that was so crazy.

1236
01:21:40,025 --> 01:21:41,505
I had no idea if that was gonna work.

1237
01:21:41,568 --> 01:21:43,445
- The case.
- The case is...

1238
01:21:43,611 --> 01:21:45,613
Where's the case? Where's Loki?

1239
01:21:46,614 --> 01:21:47,615
Loki!

1240
01:21:47,782 --> 01:21:49,093
That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?

1241
01:21:49,117 --> 01:21:50,243
We blew it.

1242
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:51,911
Loki?

1243
01:21:53,955 --> 01:21:55,248
Tony, what's going on?

1244
01:21:56,249 --> 01:21:57,917
Tell me you found that Cube.

1245
01:22:00,795 --> 01:22:02,213
You got to be shitting me.

1246
01:22:06,301 --> 01:22:08,511
I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.

1247
01:22:08,678 --> 01:22:10,055
I'm not Loki...

1248
01:22:13,641 --> 01:22:15,268
and I don't wanna hurt you.

1249
01:22:24,194 --> 01:22:25,195
I can do this all day.

1250
01:22:25,362 --> 01:22:26,654
Yeah, I know.

1251
01:22:26,821 --> 01:22:27,822
I know.

1252
01:23:00,563 --> 01:23:01,564
Where did you get this?

1253
01:23:12,867 --> 01:23:15,912
Bucky is alive.

1254
01:23:19,457 --> 01:23:20,500
What?

1255
01:23:35,432 --> 01:23:36,975
That is America's ass.

1256
01:23:41,354 --> 01:23:42,355
Please, please.

1257
01:23:42,522 --> 01:23:44,399
I'm sorry, I can't help you, Bruce.

1258
01:23:45,442 --> 01:23:48,570
If I give up the Time Stone
to help your reality, I'm dooming my own.

1259
01:23:48,737 --> 01:23:50,488
With all due respect, all right...

1260
01:23:50,655 --> 01:23:53,742
I'm not sure
the science really supports that.

1261
01:23:59,372 --> 01:24:03,668
The Infinity Stones create
what you experience as the flow of time.

1262
01:24:03,835 --> 01:24:05,378
Remove one of the stones...

1263
01:24:05,545 --> 01:24:07,630
and that flow splits.

1264
01:24:07,797 --> 01:24:10,258
Now, this may benefit your reality...

1265
01:24:10,425 --> 01:24:12,552
but my new one, not so much.

1266
01:24:12,927 --> 01:24:14,637
In this new branch reality...

1267
01:24:14,804 --> 01:24:17,891
without our chief weapon against
the forces of darkness...

1268
01:24:18,308 --> 01:24:20,226
our world would be overrun.

1269
01:24:20,393 --> 01:24:22,103
Millions will suffer.

1270
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:23,521
So, tell me, Doctor.

1271
01:24:24,105 --> 01:24:26,274
Can your science prevent all that?

1272
01:24:26,441 --> 01:24:27,442
No...

1273
01:24:28,443 --> 01:24:29,569
but we can erase it.

1274
01:24:29,736 --> 01:24:31,446
Because once we're done with the stones...

1275
01:24:31,613 --> 01:24:33,782
we can return each one
to its own timeline...

1276
01:24:33,948 --> 01:24:35,450
at the moment it was taken.

1277
01:24:35,617 --> 01:24:38,078
So, chronologically...

1278
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,163
in that reality...

1279
01:24:42,749 --> 01:24:44,417
it never left.

1280
01:24:46,795 --> 01:24:49,881
Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.

1281
01:24:53,468 --> 01:24:55,929
In order to return the stones,
you have to survive.

1282
01:24:56,096 --> 01:24:58,682
We will. I will. I promise.

1283
01:24:59,516 --> 01:25:01,559
I can't risk this reality on a promise.

1284
01:25:03,228 --> 01:25:07,857
It's the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme
to protect the Time Stone.

1285
01:25:08,233 --> 01:25:10,110
Then why the hell did Strange give it away?

1286
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:13,154
What did you say?

1287
01:25:13,321 --> 01:25:15,657
Strange. He gave it away.
He gave it to Thanos.

1288
01:25:16,282 --> 01:25:17,867
- Willingly?
- Yes.

1289
01:25:21,788 --> 01:25:23,373
- Why?
- I have no idea.

1290
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:25,291
Maybe he made a mistake.

1291
01:25:35,427 --> 01:25:36,720
Or I did.

1292
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:59,409
Strange is meant to be the best of us.

1293
01:25:59,576 --> 01:26:02,078
So, he must've done it for a reason.

1294
01:26:02,871 --> 01:26:04,497
I fear you might be right.

1295
01:26:09,669 --> 01:26:10,670
Thank you.

1296
01:26:16,926 --> 01:26:18,595
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1297
01:26:20,638 --> 01:26:21,848
We all are.

1298
01:26:42,327 --> 01:26:43,870
Run diagnostics.

1299
01:26:44,621 --> 01:26:46,581
Show me her memory file.

1300
01:26:48,166 --> 01:26:50,627
Sire, the file appears entangled.

1301
01:26:51,795 --> 01:26:53,755
It was a memory, but not hers.

1302
01:26:55,006 --> 01:26:56,424
There's another consciousness...

1303
01:26:56,591 --> 01:26:57,884
sharing her network.

1304
01:26:58,426 --> 01:26:59,761
Another Nebula.

1305
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:03,348
Impossible.

1306
01:27:03,515 --> 01:27:06,142
This duplicate carries a time stamp...

1307
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:09,229
from nine years in the future.

1308
01:27:13,817 --> 01:27:16,319
Where is this other Nebula?

1309
01:27:16,986 --> 01:27:18,988
In our solar system on Morag.

1310
01:27:20,532 --> 01:27:21,825
Can you access her?

1311
01:27:21,991 --> 01:27:24,035
Yes, the two are linked.

1312
01:27:24,202 --> 01:27:26,287
Search the duplicate's memories...

1313
01:27:26,454 --> 01:27:28,665
for Infinity Stones.

1314
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:35,171
And these stones have been in a lot of
different places throughout history.

1315
01:27:35,338 --> 01:27:36,339
Our history.

1316
01:27:36,506 --> 01:27:38,633
So, not a lot of convenient spots...

1317
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:39,926
to just drop in.

1318
01:27:40,093 --> 01:27:41,761
Which means we have to pick our targets.

1319
01:27:41,928 --> 01:27:43,221
- Correct.
- Freeze image.

1320
01:27:45,181 --> 01:27:46,391
Terrans.

1321
01:27:47,475 --> 01:27:49,144
Avengers.

1322
01:27:50,228 --> 01:27:51,938
Unruly wretches.

1323
01:27:52,105 --> 01:27:53,606
What's that reflection?

1324
01:27:55,233 --> 01:27:56,401
Amplify this, Maw.

1325
01:27:59,904 --> 01:28:01,114
I don't understand.

1326
01:28:05,827 --> 01:28:07,412
Two Nebulas.

1327
01:28:07,579 --> 01:28:09,998
No. The same Nebula...

1328
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:12,542
from two different times.

1329
01:28:13,835 --> 01:28:15,462
Set course for Morag.

1330
01:28:15,628 --> 01:28:18,006
And scan the duplicate's memories.

1331
01:28:18,757 --> 01:28:21,134
I wanna see everything.

1332
01:28:30,935 --> 01:28:34,397
My ladies, I'll see you after.
I'll see you after. Go on ahead.

1333
01:28:48,787 --> 01:28:49,788
What are you doing?

1334
01:28:51,414 --> 01:28:52,624
Oh, God!

1335
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:55,251
You're better off
leaving the sneaking to your brother.

1336
01:28:55,418 --> 01:28:57,418
No, I wasn't sneaking.
I was just going for a walk.

1337
01:28:57,462 --> 01:28:58,797
What are you wearing?

1338
01:28:58,963 --> 01:29:01,341
I always wear this.
It's one of my favorites.

1339
01:29:05,428 --> 01:29:06,805
What's wrong with your eye?

1340
01:29:06,971 --> 01:29:07,972
Oh, my eye.

1341
01:29:08,139 --> 01:29:10,100
Remember the Battle of Harokin...

1342
01:29:10,266 --> 01:29:13,353
when I got hit in the face
with the broadsword?

1343
01:29:16,898 --> 01:29:18,942
You're not the Thor I know at all, are you?

1344
01:29:19,693 --> 01:29:21,444
Yes, I am.

1345
01:29:21,945 --> 01:29:24,447
The future hasn't been kind to you, has it?

1346
01:29:24,906 --> 01:29:26,825
I didn't say I was from the future.

1347
01:29:27,283 --> 01:29:29,828
I was raised by witches, boy.

1348
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:33,248
I see with more than eyes,
you know that.

1349
01:29:35,333 --> 01:29:37,585
Yeah, I'm totally from the future.

1350
01:29:37,752 --> 01:29:39,379
Yes, you are, honey.

1351
01:29:39,546 --> 01:29:41,047
I really need to talk to you.

1352
01:29:41,214 --> 01:29:42,215
We can talk.

1353
01:30:06,364 --> 01:30:08,324
His head was over there...

1354
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:11,453
and his body over there...

1355
01:30:12,746 --> 01:30:15,248
I mean, what was the point?
I was too late.

1356
01:30:15,915 --> 01:30:17,542
I was just standing there.

1357
01:30:18,501 --> 01:30:20,253
Some idiot with an axe.

1358
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:22,130
Now, you're no idiot.

1359
01:30:23,256 --> 01:30:24,841
You're here, aren't you?

1360
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:27,510
Seeking counsel
from the wisest person in Asgard.

1361
01:30:27,844 --> 01:30:28,887
I am. Yes.

1362
01:30:29,054 --> 01:30:30,388
Idiot, no.

1363
01:30:30,555 --> 01:30:32,057
A failure?

1364
01:30:32,223 --> 01:30:33,350
Absolutely.

1365
01:30:33,516 --> 01:30:35,310
That's a little bit harsh.

1366
01:30:35,477 --> 01:30:36,978
Do you know what that makes you?

1367
01:30:38,188 --> 01:30:40,190
Just like everyone else.

1368
01:30:40,357 --> 01:30:43,234
I'm not supposed to be
like everyone else, am I?

1369
01:30:43,735 --> 01:30:46,905
Everyone fails
at who they're supposed to be, Thor.

1370
01:30:47,614 --> 01:30:50,658
The measure of a person, of a hero...

1371
01:30:50,825 --> 01:30:54,204
is how well they succeed
at being who they are.

1372
01:30:59,459 --> 01:31:00,919
I've really missed you, Mom.

1373
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,551
Thor! I got it!

1374
01:31:09,427 --> 01:31:10,970
Get that rabbit!

1375
01:31:13,973 --> 01:31:15,558
Mom, I have to tell you something.

1376
01:31:15,725 --> 01:31:17,519
No, son, you don't.

1377
01:31:17,686 --> 01:31:20,188
You're here to repair your
future, not mine.

1378
01:31:20,355 --> 01:31:22,023
This is about your future.

1379
01:31:22,190 --> 01:31:23,525
It's none of my business.

1380
01:31:27,529 --> 01:31:28,780
Hi.

1381
01:31:28,947 --> 01:31:30,949
You must be Mom.

1382
01:31:31,116 --> 01:31:32,716
I got the thing.
Come on. We got to move.

1383
01:31:32,742 --> 01:31:34,202
I wish we had more time.

1384
01:31:34,369 --> 01:31:36,204
No, this was a gift.

1385
01:31:36,371 --> 01:31:39,791
Now you go and be the man
you're meant to be.

1386
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:41,334
I love you, Mom.

1387
01:31:41,501 --> 01:31:42,501
I love you.

1388
01:31:46,881 --> 01:31:48,800
And eat a salad.

1389
01:31:49,801 --> 01:31:50,927
Come on, we got to go.

1390
01:31:51,094 --> 01:31:52,679
- Goodbye.
- Three...

1391
01:31:52,846 --> 01:31:53,930
- Two...
- No, wait!

1392
01:31:57,183 --> 01:31:58,393
What am I looking at?

1393
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,020
Sometimes it takes a second.

1394
01:32:09,904 --> 01:32:11,531
I'm still worthy.

1395
01:32:12,949 --> 01:32:14,576
Oh, boy.

1396
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,662
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Goodbye.

1397
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:58,536
So, he's an idiot?

1398
01:32:59,871 --> 01:33:01,289
Yeah.

1399
01:33:09,798 --> 01:33:11,007
What's that?

1400
01:33:11,174 --> 01:33:13,051
The tool of a thief.

1401
01:33:22,811 --> 01:33:24,451
This is the part where spikes come out...

1402
01:33:24,604 --> 01:33:26,165
with skeletons on the end of them
and everything.

1403
01:33:26,189 --> 01:33:27,399
What are you talking about?

1404
01:33:27,565 --> 01:33:30,044
When you break into a place called
"The Temple of the Power Stone"...

1405
01:33:30,068 --> 01:33:31,504
there's gonna be a bunch of booby traps.

1406
01:33:31,528 --> 01:33:33,780
- Oh, my God.
- Okay. All right. Go ahead.

1407
01:34:07,063 --> 01:34:08,565
I wasn't always like this.

1408
01:34:09,482 --> 01:34:10,483
Me either.

1409
01:34:12,277 --> 01:34:13,737
But we work with what we got, right?

1410
01:34:17,490 --> 01:34:19,159
Let's sync up.

1411
01:34:21,036 --> 01:34:23,496
Three, two, one.

1412
01:34:36,343 --> 01:34:37,969
You murdered trillions!

1413
01:34:38,136 --> 01:34:39,554
You should be grateful.

1414
01:34:41,181 --> 01:34:42,766
Where are the stones?

1415
01:34:42,932 --> 01:34:43,933
Gone.

1416
01:34:44,684 --> 01:34:45,685
Reduced to atoms.

1417
01:34:46,394 --> 01:34:48,063
You used them two days ago!

1418
01:34:48,355 --> 01:34:51,358
I used the stones to destroy the stones.

1419
01:34:51,524 --> 01:34:53,360
It nearly killed me.

1420
01:34:53,526 --> 01:34:55,445
But the work is done.

1421
01:34:55,612 --> 01:34:57,447
It always will be.

1422
01:34:58,740 --> 01:35:02,202
I am inevitable.

1423
01:35:03,453 --> 01:35:05,497
What did you do to them?

1424
01:35:05,663 --> 01:35:06,915
Nothing.

1425
01:35:07,791 --> 01:35:09,084
Yet.

1426
01:35:10,877 --> 01:35:14,589
They're not trying to stop something
I'm going to do in our time.

1427
01:35:14,923 --> 01:35:18,551
They're trying to undo something
I've already done in theirs.

1428
01:35:18,718 --> 01:35:20,387
The stones.

1429
01:35:21,304 --> 01:35:23,223
I found them all.

1430
01:35:25,016 --> 01:35:26,393
I won.

1431
01:35:27,143 --> 01:35:30,105
Tipped the cosmic scales to balance.

1432
01:35:34,109 --> 01:35:35,860
This is your future.

1433
01:35:36,194 --> 01:35:38,238
It's my destiny.

1434
01:35:39,447 --> 01:35:41,491
My father is many things.

1435
01:35:41,658 --> 01:35:43,493
A liar is not one of them.

1436
01:35:47,205 --> 01:35:49,124
Thank you, daughter.

1437
01:35:49,290 --> 01:35:51,459
Perhaps I treated you too harshly.

1438
01:35:55,964 --> 01:35:58,842
And that is destiny fulfilled.

1439
01:35:59,259 --> 01:36:00,635
Sire...

1440
01:36:00,802 --> 01:36:01,928
your daughter...

1441
01:36:04,389 --> 01:36:05,390
No!

1442
01:36:05,849 --> 01:36:06,891
Is a traitor.

1443
01:36:07,058 --> 01:36:09,519
That's not me.
It's not, I could never...

1444
01:36:09,686 --> 01:36:10,854
I would never betray you.

1445
01:36:11,021 --> 01:36:12,856
Never. Never.

1446
01:36:18,611 --> 01:36:19,779
I know.

1447
01:36:20,739 --> 01:36:23,992
And you'll have the chance to prove it.

1448
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:31,374
No!

1449
01:36:32,083 --> 01:36:33,293
He knows!

1450
01:36:37,881 --> 01:36:39,924
Barton! Barton, come in.

1451
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:41,843
Romanoff!

1452
01:36:42,469 --> 01:36:43,887
Come in, we have a problem.

1453
01:36:44,054 --> 01:36:45,180
Come on!

1454
01:36:45,347 --> 01:36:46,765
Come in, we have a...

1455
01:36:46,931 --> 01:36:48,266
Thanos knows.

1456
01:36:48,933 --> 01:36:50,185
Thanos...

1457
01:37:03,907 --> 01:37:04,991
Cap.

1458
01:37:06,618 --> 01:37:08,870
Sorry, buddy, we got a problem.

1459
01:37:09,704 --> 01:37:11,039
Yeah, we do.

1460
01:37:11,623 --> 01:37:12,767
Well, what are we gonna do now?

1461
01:37:12,791 --> 01:37:13,934
You know what? Give me a break, Steve.

1462
01:37:13,958 --> 01:37:15,519
I just got hit in the head with the Hulk.

1463
01:37:15,543 --> 01:37:16,961
You said that we had one shot.

1464
01:37:17,128 --> 01:37:18,463
This was our shot.

1465
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:20,632
We shot it. It's shot.
Six stones or nothing.

1466
01:37:20,799 --> 01:37:22,318
- It was six stones or nothing.
- You're repeating yourself, you know that?

1467
01:37:22,342 --> 01:37:23,382
You're repeating yourself.

1468
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:25,363
You're repeating yourself.
You're repeating yourself.

1469
01:37:25,387 --> 01:37:27,323
- Dude. Come on!
- No. You never wanted a time heist.

1470
01:37:27,347 --> 01:37:28,491
You weren't on board with the time heist.

1471
01:37:28,515 --> 01:37:29,784
- I dropped the ball.
- You ruined the time heist.

1472
01:37:29,808 --> 01:37:31,101
- Is that what I did?
- Yeah.

1473
01:37:31,267 --> 01:37:33,107
Are there any other options
with the Tesseract?

1474
01:37:33,228 --> 01:37:34,580
No, no, no,
there's no other options.

1475
01:37:34,604 --> 01:37:35,855
There's no do-overs.

1476
01:37:36,022 --> 01:37:38,250
We're not going anywhere else.
We have one particle left.

1477
01:37:38,274 --> 01:37:39,109
Each.

1478
01:37:39,275 --> 01:37:41,569
That's it. All right?
We use that...

1479
01:37:41,736 --> 01:37:42,976
bye-bye, you're not going home.

1480
01:37:43,071 --> 01:37:45,031
Yeah, well, if we don't try...

1481
01:37:45,198 --> 01:37:46,509
then no one else is going home, either.

1482
01:37:46,533 --> 01:37:47,533
I got it.

1483
01:37:48,743 --> 01:37:52,789
There's another way to retake the Tesseract
and acquire new particles.

1484
01:37:53,623 --> 01:37:54,863
Little stroll down memory lane.

1485
01:37:55,458 --> 01:37:57,293
Military installation, Garden State.

1486
01:38:01,381 --> 01:38:02,674
When were they both there?

1487
01:38:02,841 --> 01:38:05,218
They were there at a time...
I have a vaguely exact idea.

1488
01:38:05,885 --> 01:38:07,029
- How vague?
- What are you talking about?

1489
01:38:07,053 --> 01:38:08,053
Where are we going?

1490
01:38:08,096 --> 01:38:09,156
I know for a fact they were there.

1491
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:11,420
- Who's they? What are we doing?
- And I know how I know.

1492
01:38:13,268 --> 01:38:14,811
Guys, what is it?

1493
01:38:15,395 --> 01:38:17,022
Looks like we're improvising.

1494
01:38:17,188 --> 01:38:18,457
- Great.
- What are we improvising?

1495
01:38:18,481 --> 01:38:20,233
Scott, get this back to the compound.

1496
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:21,400
Suit up.

1497
01:38:21,651 --> 01:38:23,111
- What's in New Jersey?
- 0-4.

1498
01:38:23,278 --> 01:38:24,112
0-4.

1499
01:38:24,279 --> 01:38:25,280
- 0-7.
- 0-7.

1500
01:38:25,447 --> 01:38:27,323
- Excuse me.
- 1-9-7-0.

1501
01:38:27,782 --> 01:38:28,782
Are you sure?

1502
01:38:28,867 --> 01:38:30,160
Cap? Captain?

1503
01:38:30,326 --> 01:38:32,162
Steve? Sorry.

1504
01:38:32,328 --> 01:38:33,955
America. Rogers.

1505
01:38:34,122 --> 01:38:35,331
Look, if you do this...

1506
01:38:35,623 --> 01:38:38,168
and it doesn't work,
you're not coming back.

1507
01:38:39,252 --> 01:38:41,046
Thanks for the pep talk, pissant.

1508
01:38:42,088 --> 01:38:43,298
You trust me?

1509
01:38:44,174 --> 01:38:45,342
I do.

1510
01:38:46,384 --> 01:38:47,719
Your call.

1511
01:38:48,595 --> 01:38:50,305
Here we go.

1512
01:39:06,363 --> 01:39:09,991
Hey, man! Make love, not war.

1513
01:39:15,914 --> 01:39:18,583
Clearly you weren't actually
born here, right?

1514
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:20,251
The idea of me was.

1515
01:39:21,419 --> 01:39:23,059
Right.
Well, imagine you're S.H.I.E.I.D...

1516
01:39:23,129 --> 01:39:26,383
running a quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization...

1517
01:39:27,717 --> 01:39:29,302
where do you hide it?

1518
01:39:29,469 --> 01:39:31,137
In plain sight.

1519
01:39:59,541 --> 01:40:00,810
Good luck on your mission, Captain.

1520
01:40:00,834 --> 01:40:03,378
Good luck on your project, Doctor.

1521
01:40:06,798 --> 01:40:07,882
You new here?

1522
01:40:10,427 --> 01:40:11,761
Not exactly.

1523
01:40:18,435 --> 01:40:20,228
Come on, you bastard.

1524
01:40:27,027 --> 01:40:28,528
Gotcha.

1525
01:40:46,087 --> 01:40:47,756
Back in the game.

1526
01:40:50,425 --> 01:40:51,634
Arnim, you in there?

1527
01:40:52,594 --> 01:40:53,636
Arnim?

1528
01:40:58,933 --> 01:41:00,268
Hey!

1529
01:41:00,935 --> 01:41:02,645
The door is this way, pal.

1530
01:41:03,646 --> 01:41:04,646
Oh, yeah.

1531
01:41:04,689 --> 01:41:06,566
Looking for Doctor Zola, have you seen him?

1532
01:41:06,733 --> 01:41:10,153
Yeah, Doctor Zola.
No, I haven't seen a soul.

1533
01:41:11,654 --> 01:41:12,989
Pardon me.

1534
01:41:13,740 --> 01:41:15,367
Do I know you?

1535
01:41:16,618 --> 01:41:17,619
No, sir.

1536
01:41:19,079 --> 01:41:20,872
I'm a visitor from MIT.

1537
01:41:21,456 --> 01:41:22,582
MIT.

1538
01:41:23,041 --> 01:41:24,167
Got a name?

1539
01:41:24,626 --> 01:41:25,752
Howard.

1540
01:41:25,919 --> 01:41:28,421
- That'll be easy to remember.
- Howard...

1541
01:41:29,422 --> 01:41:30,423
Potts.

1542
01:41:31,007 --> 01:41:33,218
Well, I'm Howard Stark.

1543
01:41:33,385 --> 01:41:34,385
Hi.

1544
01:41:34,469 --> 01:41:35,762
Shake that, don't pull it.

1545
01:41:35,929 --> 01:41:36,930
Yeah.

1546
01:41:38,348 --> 01:41:40,558
You look a little green
around the gills, there, Potts.

1547
01:41:40,725 --> 01:41:42,894
I'm fine. Just long hours.

1548
01:41:43,061 --> 01:41:44,771
You wanna get some air?

1549
01:41:47,315 --> 01:41:49,109
- Hello, Potts.
- Yeah.

1550
01:41:49,275 --> 01:41:50,527
- That'd be swell.
- That way.

1551
01:41:50,694 --> 01:41:51,694
Okay.

1552
01:41:51,820 --> 01:41:53,488
Need your briefcase?

1553
01:41:57,826 --> 01:42:00,412
You're not one of those beatniks,
are you, Potts?

1554
01:42:06,251 --> 01:42:08,044
- Hello?
- Doctor Pym?

1555
01:42:08,211 --> 01:42:10,422
That would be the number
that you called, yes.

1556
01:42:10,588 --> 01:42:12,841
This is Captain Stevens from shipping.

1557
01:42:13,008 --> 01:42:14,134
We have a package for you.

1558
01:42:14,509 --> 01:42:15,677
Bring it up.

1559
01:42:15,844 --> 01:42:17,804
That's the thing, sir, we can't.

1560
01:42:18,930 --> 01:42:21,558
I'm confused.
I thought that was your job.

1561
01:42:21,725 --> 01:42:23,101
Well, it's just...

1562
01:42:23,268 --> 01:42:24,728
Sir, the box is glowing...

1563
01:42:24,894 --> 01:42:27,689
and to be honest, some of our mail guys
aren't feeling that great.

1564
01:42:27,856 --> 01:42:29,566
They didn't open it, did they?

1565
01:42:29,733 --> 01:42:31,901
Yeah, they did.
You better get down here.

1566
01:42:32,736 --> 01:42:34,654
Excuse me! Out of the way!

1567
01:43:01,848 --> 01:43:05,352
So, flowers and sauerkraut.
You got a big date tonight?

1568
01:43:06,102 --> 01:43:07,562
My wife's expecting.

1569
01:43:07,729 --> 01:43:10,565
And too much time at the office.

1570
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:13,777
Congratulations.

1571
01:43:13,943 --> 01:43:16,071
- Thanks. Hold this, will ya?
- Yeah, sure.

1572
01:43:17,155 --> 01:43:19,240
- How far along is she?
- I don't know.

1573
01:43:21,034 --> 01:43:23,787
She's at the point where
she can't stand the sound of my chewing.

1574
01:43:23,953 --> 01:43:27,415
I guess I'll be eating dinner
in the pantry again.

1575
01:43:28,333 --> 01:43:29,334
I have a little girl.

1576
01:43:29,501 --> 01:43:31,002
A girl would be nice.

1577
01:43:31,169 --> 01:43:33,171
Less of a chance
she'd turn out exactly like me.

1578
01:43:33,838 --> 01:43:35,298
What'd be so awful about that?

1579
01:43:35,465 --> 01:43:40,845
Let's just say that the greater good
has rarely outweighed my own self-interest.

1580
01:43:44,891 --> 01:43:46,077
And you've never seen these two men before?

1581
01:43:46,101 --> 01:43:48,079
No, I've got an eye for this.
The two of them looked fishy.

1582
01:43:48,103 --> 01:43:50,384
- Can you describe them?
- One of them had a hippie beard.

1583
01:43:50,522 --> 01:43:52,691
Hippie. Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

1584
01:43:52,857 --> 01:43:53,900
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

1585
01:43:54,067 --> 01:43:56,379
Yeah, this is Chesler.
I need every available MP to sublevel six.

1586
01:43:56,403 --> 01:43:58,279
We have a potential breach.

1587
01:44:16,172 --> 01:44:17,172
I said bring them in.

1588
01:44:17,298 --> 01:44:19,610
They're trying, ma'am, but Braddock's unit
has been stopped by lightning strikes.

1589
01:44:19,634 --> 01:44:20,468
Oh, for the love of...

1590
01:44:20,635 --> 01:44:22,137
I'll look at the weather projections.

1591
01:44:46,161 --> 01:44:48,163
It's not lightning
strikes we're looking at.

1592
01:44:59,507 --> 01:45:01,217
So, where you at with names?

1593
01:45:01,384 --> 01:45:04,512
Well, if it's a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo.

1594
01:45:05,472 --> 01:45:07,766
Might wanna let that stew awhile.
You got time.

1595
01:45:09,559 --> 01:45:11,061
Let me ask you a question.

1596
01:45:12,062 --> 01:45:15,315
When your kid was born, were you nervous?

1597
01:45:15,482 --> 01:45:16,816
Wildly.

1598
01:45:17,067 --> 01:45:18,777
- Yeah.
- Did you feel qualified?

1599
01:45:18,943 --> 01:45:22,530
Like you had any idea
how to successfully operate that thing?

1600
01:45:22,947 --> 01:45:25,784
I literally pieced it together
as I went along.

1601
01:45:25,950 --> 01:45:27,952
I thought about what my dad did.

1602
01:45:28,661 --> 01:45:31,221
My old man, he never met a problem
he couldn't solve with a belt.

1603
01:45:31,623 --> 01:45:33,667
I thought my dad was tough on me.

1604
01:45:33,833 --> 01:45:36,544
And now, looking back on it,
I just remember the good stuff.

1605
01:45:36,711 --> 01:45:38,296
You know?
He did drop the odd pearl.

1606
01:45:38,463 --> 01:45:39,839
Yeah? Like what?

1607
01:45:40,965 --> 01:45:43,468
"No amount of money
ever bought a second of time."

1608
01:45:44,803 --> 01:45:45,845
Smart guy.

1609
01:45:46,262 --> 01:45:47,722
He did his best.

1610
01:45:49,099 --> 01:45:53,061
I'll tell you, that kid's not even here yet
and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him.

1611
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:03,196
Good to meet you, Potts.

1612
01:46:03,863 --> 01:46:04,863
Yeah.

1613
01:46:05,115 --> 01:46:06,282
Howard...

1614
01:46:06,866 --> 01:46:08,451
everything's gonna be all right.

1615
01:46:11,454 --> 01:46:12,706
Thank you...

1616
01:46:13,665 --> 01:46:15,000
for everything...

1617
01:46:15,417 --> 01:46:17,711
you've done for this country.

1618
01:46:20,588 --> 01:46:21,715
Jarvis.

1619
01:46:25,427 --> 01:46:26,970
Have we ever met that guy?

1620
01:46:28,972 --> 01:46:30,473
You meet a lot of people, sir.

1621
01:46:33,101 --> 01:46:34,728
Seems very familiar.

1622
01:46:35,645 --> 01:46:37,105
Weird beard.

1623
01:46:45,447 --> 01:46:46,448
You're weak.

1624
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:48,074
I'm you.

1625
01:47:05,717 --> 01:47:07,802
You could stop this.

1626
01:47:08,094 --> 01:47:09,888
You know you want to.

1627
01:47:10,597 --> 01:47:12,766
Did you see what happens in the future?

1628
01:47:14,059 --> 01:47:16,436
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1629
01:47:17,979 --> 01:47:19,981
You wanna know how he does that?

1630
01:47:21,358 --> 01:47:25,528
You wanna know what he does to you?

1631
01:47:26,029 --> 01:47:27,030
That's enough.

1632
01:47:39,709 --> 01:47:41,294
You disgust me.

1633
01:47:42,587 --> 01:47:47,467
But that doesn't mean you're useless.

1634
01:48:09,155 --> 01:48:10,865
How do I look?

1635
01:48:17,455 --> 01:48:18,456
Wow.

1636
01:48:19,457 --> 01:48:22,585
Under different circumstances...

1637
01:48:22,752 --> 01:48:24,754
this would be totally awesome.

1638
01:48:36,891 --> 01:48:39,728
I bet the raccoon
didn't have to climb a mountain.

1639
01:48:39,894 --> 01:48:41,813
Technically he's not a raccoon, you know?

1640
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:43,523
Whatever. He eats garbage.

1641
01:48:43,690 --> 01:48:45,025
Welcome.

1642
01:48:48,194 --> 01:48:49,529
Natasha.

1643
01:48:49,696 --> 01:48:50,697
Daughter of Ivan.

1644
01:48:52,032 --> 01:48:53,158
Clint.

1645
01:48:53,324 --> 01:48:55,618
Son of Edith.

1646
01:49:00,999 --> 01:49:02,459
Who are you?

1647
01:49:03,084 --> 01:49:05,545
Consider me a guide...

1648
01:49:05,712 --> 01:49:07,380
to you...

1649
01:49:07,547 --> 01:49:09,382
and to all who seek the Soul Stone.

1650
01:49:09,549 --> 01:49:10,592
Oh, good.

1651
01:49:10,759 --> 01:49:12,886
You tell us where it is,
then we'll be on our way.

1652
01:49:16,806 --> 01:49:19,059
If only it were that easy.

1653
01:49:31,154 --> 01:49:34,866
What you seek lies in front of you.

1654
01:49:36,117 --> 01:49:38,536
As does what you fear.

1655
01:49:43,458 --> 01:49:45,335
The stone's down there.

1656
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:47,879
For one of you.

1657
01:49:48,171 --> 01:49:49,881
For the other...

1658
01:49:52,550 --> 01:49:54,469
In order to take the stone...

1659
01:49:54,636 --> 01:49:57,639
you must lose that which you love.

1660
01:49:59,015 --> 01:50:02,185
An everlasting exchange.

1661
01:50:03,186 --> 01:50:07,273
A soul for a soul.

1662
01:50:09,859 --> 01:50:11,236
How's it going?

1663
01:50:14,656 --> 01:50:16,074
Jesus.

1664
01:50:16,408 --> 01:50:18,118
Maybe he's making this shit up.

1665
01:50:18,993 --> 01:50:20,328
No.

1666
01:50:21,162 --> 01:50:22,163
I don't think so.

1667
01:50:22,872 --> 01:50:25,041
Why? 'Cause he knows your daddy's name?

1668
01:50:26,668 --> 01:50:27,668
I didn't.

1669
01:50:29,087 --> 01:50:31,464
Thanos left here with the stone...

1670
01:50:32,132 --> 01:50:33,675
without his daughter.

1671
01:50:33,842 --> 01:50:35,927
That's not a coincidence.

1672
01:50:37,012 --> 01:50:38,638
Yeah.

1673
01:50:40,348 --> 01:50:42,225
Whatever it takes.

1674
01:50:46,730 --> 01:50:48,231
Whatever it takes.

1675
01:50:52,610 --> 01:50:54,571
If we don't get that stone...

1676
01:50:54,738 --> 01:50:56,406
billions of people stay dead.

1677
01:50:57,282 --> 01:50:58,450
Yeah.

1678
01:51:00,326 --> 01:51:02,454
Then I guess we both know
who it's got to be.

1679
01:51:03,204 --> 01:51:04,372
I guess we do.

1680
01:51:12,797 --> 01:51:17,510
I'm starting to think
we mean different people here, Natasha.

1681
01:51:18,011 --> 01:51:19,989
For the last five years,
I've been trying to do one thing.

1682
01:51:20,013 --> 01:51:21,264
Get to right here.

1683
01:51:21,431 --> 01:51:23,471
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

1684
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:25,810
No, don't you get all decent on me now.

1685
01:51:25,977 --> 01:51:27,979
What, you think I wanna do it?

1686
01:51:28,563 --> 01:51:30,315
I'm trying to save your life, you idiot.

1687
01:51:30,482 --> 01:51:32,817
Yeah, well, I don't want you to.
How's that?

1688
01:51:33,735 --> 01:51:35,945
Natasha, you know what I've done.

1689
01:51:37,614 --> 01:51:39,407
You know what I've become.

1690
01:51:41,534 --> 01:51:44,120
I don't judge people
on their worst mistakes.

1691
01:51:48,291 --> 01:51:49,542
Maybe you should.

1692
01:51:50,418 --> 01:51:51,961
You didn't.

1693
01:51:58,134 --> 01:52:00,345
You're a pain in my ass, you know that?

1694
01:52:11,439 --> 01:52:12,649
Okay.

1695
01:52:14,401 --> 01:52:15,902
You win.

1696
01:52:22,367 --> 01:52:23,535
Tell my family I love 'em.

1697
01:52:27,247 --> 01:52:28,456
You tell 'em yourself.

1698
01:53:01,322 --> 01:53:02,323
Damn you.

1699
01:53:09,831 --> 01:53:10,832
Wait.

1700
01:53:18,882 --> 01:53:20,717
Let me go.

1701
01:53:21,968 --> 01:53:22,969
No.

1702
01:53:24,721 --> 01:53:25,722
No. Please, no.

1703
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:30,935
It's okay.

1704
01:53:33,146 --> 01:53:34,146
Please.

1705
01:53:36,066 --> 01:53:37,067
No!

1706
01:55:18,543 --> 01:55:19,544
Did we get 'em all?

1707
01:55:20,962 --> 01:55:22,756
Are you telling me this actually worked?

1708
01:55:27,594 --> 01:55:28,803
Clint, where's Nat?

1709
01:55:58,041 --> 01:55:59,201
Do we know if she had family?

1710
01:56:00,210 --> 01:56:01,378
Yeah.

1711
01:56:01,544 --> 01:56:02,545
Us.

1712
01:56:03,963 --> 01:56:05,006
What?

1713
01:56:06,966 --> 01:56:08,277
- What are you doing?
- Just asked him a question.

1714
01:56:08,301 --> 01:56:09,695
Yeah, no, you're acting like she's dead.

1715
01:56:09,719 --> 01:56:12,180
Why are we acting like she's dead?
We have the stones, right?

1716
01:56:12,347 --> 01:56:13,491
As long as we have the stones...

1717
01:56:13,515 --> 01:56:15,275
Cap, we can bring her back.
Isn't that right?

1718
01:56:15,433 --> 01:56:17,578
So, stop this shit. We're the Avengers.
Get it together.

1719
01:56:17,602 --> 01:56:18,812
Can't get her back.

1720
01:56:21,815 --> 01:56:23,066
What's he...? What?

1721
01:56:23,233 --> 01:56:24,442
It can't be undone.

1722
01:56:25,026 --> 01:56:26,736
It can't.

1723
01:56:29,239 --> 01:56:32,367
Look, I'm sorry, no offense,
but you're a very earthly being, okay?

1724
01:56:32,534 --> 01:56:33,969
And we're talking about space magic.

1725
01:56:33,993 --> 01:56:35,995
And "can't" seems very definitive.
Don't you think?

1726
01:56:36,162 --> 01:56:38,998
Yeah, look, I know that I'm way outside
my pay grade here.

1727
01:56:39,165 --> 01:56:40,625
But she still isn't here, is she?

1728
01:56:40,792 --> 01:56:41,793
No, that's my point.

1729
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:44,921
It can't be undone.

1730
01:56:45,088 --> 01:56:48,425
Or that's at least
what the red, floating guy had to say.

1731
01:56:48,591 --> 01:56:50,071
Maybe you wanna go talk to him, okay?

1732
01:56:50,218 --> 01:56:53,263
Go grab your hammer
and you go fly and you talk to him.

1733
01:57:01,813 --> 01:57:03,857
It was supposed to be me.

1734
01:57:06,109 --> 01:57:08,403
She sacrificed her life
for that goddamn stone.

1735
01:57:08,570 --> 01:57:10,030
She bet her life on it.

1736
01:57:14,951 --> 01:57:17,287
She's not coming back.

1737
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:20,623
We have to make it worth it.

1738
01:57:21,124 --> 01:57:22,584
We have to.

1739
01:57:24,002 --> 01:57:25,670
We will.

1740
01:57:50,362 --> 01:57:51,488
Boom!

1741
01:57:57,160 --> 01:57:58,620
All right, the glove's ready.

1742
01:57:59,412 --> 01:58:01,998
Question is,
who's gonna snap their freakin' fingers?

1743
01:58:02,165 --> 01:58:04,250
- I'll do it.
- Excuse me?

1744
01:58:04,417 --> 01:58:05,417
It's okay.

1745
01:58:05,543 --> 01:58:06,543
Stop, stop. Slow down.

1746
01:58:06,628 --> 01:58:08,129
Thor. Just wait.

1747
01:58:08,296 --> 01:58:10,136
We haven't decided
who's gonna put that on yet.

1748
01:58:10,507 --> 01:58:13,569
I'm sorry. What, we're all just sitting
around waiting for the right opportunity?

1749
01:58:13,593 --> 01:58:14,793
We should at least discuss it.

1750
01:58:14,886 --> 01:58:18,723
Look, sitting here staring at the thing
is not gonna bring everybody back.

1751
01:58:19,766 --> 01:58:22,686
I'm the strongest Avenger, okay?
So, this responsibility falls upon me.

1752
01:58:22,852 --> 01:58:24,205
- Normally, you're right.
- It's my duty.

1753
01:58:24,229 --> 01:58:26,022
- It's not about that.
- It's not that.

1754
01:58:26,189 --> 01:58:27,982
- Hey, buddy...
- Stop it! Just let me.

1755
01:58:30,985 --> 01:58:32,487
Just let me do it.

1756
01:58:32,654 --> 01:58:35,156
Just let me do something good.
Something right.

1757
01:58:35,323 --> 01:58:36,467
Look, it's not just the fact...

1758
01:58:36,491 --> 01:58:38,761
that that glove is channeling enough energy
to light up a continent.

1759
01:58:38,785 --> 01:58:40,787
I'm telling you.
You're in no condition.

1760
01:58:40,954 --> 01:58:43,998
What do you think
is coursing through my veins right now?

1761
01:58:44,165 --> 01:58:45,208
Cheez Whiz?

1762
01:58:47,752 --> 01:58:48,753
Lightning.

1763
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:50,046
- Yeah.
- Lightning.

1764
01:58:50,213 --> 01:58:51,589
Lightning won't help you, pal.

1765
01:58:51,756 --> 01:58:53,591
It's got to be me.

1766
01:58:54,926 --> 01:58:57,095
You saw what those stones did to Thanos.

1767
01:58:57,262 --> 01:58:58,805
They almost killed him.

1768
01:59:00,223 --> 01:59:02,100
None of you could survive.

1769
01:59:02,809 --> 01:59:04,436
How do we know you will?

1770
01:59:04,602 --> 01:59:05,645
We don't.

1771
01:59:05,937 --> 01:59:08,481
But the radiation's mostly gamma.

1772
01:59:11,985 --> 01:59:13,570
It's like...

1773
01:59:15,447 --> 01:59:17,365
I was made for this.

1774
01:59:36,301 --> 01:59:37,802
Good to go, yeah?

1775
01:59:39,929 --> 01:59:40,930
Let's do it.

1776
01:59:41,097 --> 01:59:44,142
Okay, remember, everyone
Thanos snapped away five years ago...

1777
01:59:44,309 --> 01:59:46,770
you're just bringing them
back to now, today.

1778
01:59:46,936 --> 01:59:48,776
Don't change anything
from the last five years.

1779
01:59:49,773 --> 01:59:50,940
Got it.

1780
02:00:07,332 --> 02:00:10,126
Friday, do me a favor
and activate Barn Door Protocol, will ya?

1781
02:00:10,293 --> 02:00:11,586
Yes, boss.

1782
02:00:20,178 --> 02:00:22,013
Everybody comes home.

1783
02:00:45,412 --> 02:00:46,830
Take it off! Take it off!

1784
02:00:46,996 --> 02:00:48,196
No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?

1785
02:00:49,290 --> 02:00:50,500
Talk to me, Banner.

1786
02:00:53,670 --> 02:00:54,671
I'm okay.

1787
02:00:55,171 --> 02:00:56,464
I'm okay.

1788
02:01:27,912 --> 02:01:29,039
Bruce!

1789
02:01:30,790 --> 02:01:32,375
Don't move him.

1790
02:01:39,257 --> 02:01:41,259
- Did it work?
- We're not sure. It's okay.

1791
02:02:27,764 --> 02:02:28,764
Honey.

1792
02:02:28,807 --> 02:02:29,807
Clint?

1793
02:02:29,933 --> 02:02:31,184
Honey.

1794
02:02:32,018 --> 02:02:33,353
Guys...

1795
02:02:35,814 --> 02:02:37,190
I think it worked.

1796
02:03:19,816 --> 02:03:21,693
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

1797
02:03:22,944 --> 02:03:24,738
Canopy, canopy, canopy.

1798
02:03:31,369 --> 02:03:33,163
Rhodey, Rocket, get out of here.

1799
02:03:34,330 --> 02:03:35,874
Let me up! Let me up!

1800
02:03:36,624 --> 02:03:37,624
Come on!

1801
02:03:47,510 --> 02:03:48,510
Rhodey!

1802
02:03:56,895 --> 02:03:59,939
Mayday, Mayday! Does anybody copy?
We're on the lower level. It's flooding!

1803
02:04:00,106 --> 02:04:01,816
What? What?

1804
02:04:01,983 --> 02:04:04,152
We are drowning!
Does anybody copy? Mayday!

1805
02:04:04,319 --> 02:04:06,488
Wait! I'm here!

1806
02:04:06,654 --> 02:04:08,156
I'm here. Can you hear me?

1807
02:04:27,801 --> 02:04:29,010
Cap?

1808
02:04:52,992 --> 02:04:54,119
Okay.

1809
02:05:13,388 --> 02:05:14,514
Daughter.

1810
02:05:14,681 --> 02:05:15,849
Yes, Father.

1811
02:05:17,726 --> 02:05:19,436
So, this is the future.

1812
02:05:20,103 --> 02:05:21,103
Well done.

1813
02:05:21,855 --> 02:05:23,356
Thank you, Father.

1814
02:05:23,523 --> 02:05:24,899
They suspected nothing.

1815
02:05:27,235 --> 02:05:28,695
The arrogant never do.

1816
02:05:31,656 --> 02:05:32,782
Go.

1817
02:05:33,742 --> 02:05:36,161
Find the stones, bring them to me.

1818
02:05:36,327 --> 02:05:38,038
What will you do?

1819
02:05:39,372 --> 02:05:41,041
Wait.

1820
02:06:06,274 --> 02:06:07,942
Tell me something.

1821
02:06:09,069 --> 02:06:11,488
In the future...

1822
02:06:11,654 --> 02:06:13,531
what happens to you and me?

1823
02:06:15,825 --> 02:06:17,452
I try to kill you.

1824
02:06:19,162 --> 02:06:20,663
Several times.

1825
02:06:21,748 --> 02:06:23,708
But eventually...

1826
02:06:23,875 --> 02:06:25,835
we become friends.

1827
02:06:27,337 --> 02:06:29,047
We become sisters.

1828
02:06:36,721 --> 02:06:37,931
Come on.

1829
02:06:39,974 --> 02:06:41,768
We can stop him.

1830
02:06:49,859 --> 02:06:51,194
Come on, buddy, wake up!

1831
02:06:51,736 --> 02:06:53,196
That's my man.

1832
02:06:54,114 --> 02:06:56,157
You lose this again,
I'm keeping it.

1833
02:06:59,703 --> 02:07:00,870
What happened?

1834
02:07:01,037 --> 02:07:03,164
You mess with time,
it tends to mess back.

1835
02:07:03,331 --> 02:07:04,331
You'll see.

1836
02:07:26,312 --> 02:07:27,689
What's he been doing?

1837
02:07:29,607 --> 02:07:31,026
Absolutely nothing.

1838
02:07:32,777 --> 02:07:34,654
Where are the stones?

1839
02:07:35,030 --> 02:07:36,865
Somewhere under all this.

1840
02:07:38,241 --> 02:07:40,452
All I know is he doesn't have 'em.

1841
02:07:40,618 --> 02:07:42,370
So, we keep it that way.

1842
02:07:42,537 --> 02:07:43,913
You know it's a trap, right?

1843
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:45,415
Yeah.

1844
02:07:45,582 --> 02:07:46,916
I don't much care.

1845
02:07:47,667 --> 02:07:48,668
Good.

1846
02:07:49,627 --> 02:07:52,130
Just as long as we're all in agreement.

1847
02:08:01,890 --> 02:08:03,892
Let's kill him properly this time.

1848
02:08:13,276 --> 02:08:16,196
You could not live with your own failure.

1849
02:08:17,697 --> 02:08:19,532
Where did that bring you?

1850
02:08:22,494 --> 02:08:24,371
Back to me.

1851
02:08:27,791 --> 02:08:30,627
I thought by eliminating half of life...

1852
02:08:31,378 --> 02:08:33,755
the other half would thrive.

1853
02:08:33,922 --> 02:08:35,256
But you've shown me...

1854
02:08:36,424 --> 02:08:38,176
that's impossible.

1855
02:08:40,095 --> 02:08:43,390
And as long as there are those
that remember what was...

1856
02:08:43,556 --> 02:08:48,770
there will always be those
that are unable to accept what can be.

1857
02:08:49,521 --> 02:08:50,772
They will resist.

1858
02:08:51,272 --> 02:08:53,191
Yep, we're all kinds of stubborn.

1859
02:08:54,109 --> 02:08:55,694
I'm thankful.

1860
02:08:57,862 --> 02:08:59,614
Because now...

1861
02:08:59,781 --> 02:09:01,908
I know what I must do.

1862
02:09:02,367 --> 02:09:05,328
I will shred this universe...

1863
02:09:05,495 --> 02:09:07,539
down to its last atom.

1864
02:09:08,331 --> 02:09:10,000
And then...

1865
02:09:10,166 --> 02:09:12,502
with the stones you've collected for me...

1866
02:09:13,294 --> 02:09:15,422
create a new one...

1867
02:09:15,588 --> 02:09:17,799
teeming with life...

1868
02:09:17,966 --> 02:09:19,843
that knows not what it has lost...

1869
02:09:20,010 --> 02:09:22,387
but only what it has been given.

1870
02:09:25,473 --> 02:09:26,891
A grateful universe.

1871
02:09:27,434 --> 02:09:28,852
Born out of blood.

1872
02:09:29,019 --> 02:09:30,687
They'll never know it.

1873
02:09:31,896 --> 02:09:34,816
Because you won't be alive to tell them.

1874
02:09:49,414 --> 02:09:50,707
See you on the other side, man.

1875
02:09:53,043 --> 02:09:55,045
Hang on! I'm coming!

1876
02:10:25,325 --> 02:10:26,326
Yeah!

1877
02:10:41,216 --> 02:10:42,759
Oh, hey.

1878
02:10:42,926 --> 02:10:44,636
I know you.

1879
02:10:47,555 --> 02:10:48,556
Father...

1880
02:10:49,307 --> 02:10:50,725
I have the stones.

1881
02:10:50,892 --> 02:10:51,892
What?

1882
02:10:53,186 --> 02:10:54,186
Stop.

1883
02:10:59,317 --> 02:11:00,735
You're betraying us?

1884
02:11:06,741 --> 02:11:08,034
You don't have to do this.

1885
02:11:10,870 --> 02:11:13,373
I am this.

1886
02:11:13,540 --> 02:11:15,458
No, you're not.

1887
02:11:15,917 --> 02:11:17,794
You've seen what we become.

1888
02:11:23,883 --> 02:11:26,094
Nebula, listen to her.

1889
02:11:27,554 --> 02:11:28,554
You can change.

1890
02:11:35,103 --> 02:11:36,604
He won't let me.

1891
02:11:38,231 --> 02:11:39,231
No!

1892
02:11:58,626 --> 02:12:00,003
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

1893
02:12:16,644 --> 02:12:17,937
Boss, wake up!

1894
02:13:09,239 --> 02:13:10,532
I knew it!

1895
02:14:32,906 --> 02:14:35,742
In all my years of conquest...

1896
02:14:37,035 --> 02:14:38,787
violence...

1897
02:14:39,829 --> 02:14:41,790
slaughter...

1898
02:14:42,916 --> 02:14:45,335
it was never personal.

1899
02:14:47,921 --> 02:14:50,006
But I'll tell you now...

1900
02:14:52,008 --> 02:14:58,264
what I'm about to do
to your stubborn, annoying little planet...

1901
02:15:00,016 --> 02:15:02,227
I'm gonna enjoy it...

1902
02:15:03,144 --> 02:15:05,730
very, very much.

1903
02:16:09,002 --> 02:16:10,545
Hey, Cap, you read me?

1904
02:16:16,551 --> 02:16:18,845
Cap, it's Sam. Can you hear me?

1905
02:16:22,849 --> 02:16:24,267
On your left.

1906
02:17:49,936 --> 02:17:51,229
Is that everyone?

1907
02:17:51,396 --> 02:17:53,606
What? You wanted more?

1908
02:18:20,133 --> 02:18:22,093
Avengers...

1909
02:18:27,223 --> 02:18:28,308
assemble.

1910
02:19:03,510 --> 02:19:04,761
Die!

1911
02:19:25,407 --> 02:19:28,159
No, no, give me that.
You have the little one.

1912
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:42,840
Hey!

1913
02:19:43,675 --> 02:19:44,676
Holy cow!

1914
02:19:44,843 --> 02:19:46,278
You will not believe what's been going on.

1915
02:19:46,302 --> 02:19:47,655
Do you remember when we were in space?

1916
02:19:47,679 --> 02:19:49,055
And I got all dusty?

1917
02:19:49,222 --> 02:19:51,891
And I must've passed out,
because I woke up and you were gone.

1918
02:19:52,058 --> 02:19:53,828
But Doctor Strange was there, right?
And he was like...

1919
02:19:53,852 --> 02:19:55,496
"It's been five years.
Come on, they need us."

1920
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:57,331
And then he started doing the yellow
sparkly thing that he does all the time.

1921
02:19:57,355 --> 02:19:58,189
He did? Oh, no.

1922
02:19:58,356 --> 02:19:59,649
What are you doing?

1923
02:20:04,696 --> 02:20:06,197
This is nice.

1924
02:20:27,969 --> 02:20:28,970
Gamora?

1925
02:20:38,396 --> 02:20:40,065
I thought I lost you.

1926
02:20:44,652 --> 02:20:47,572
Don't touch me!

1927
02:20:50,575 --> 02:20:52,410
You missed the first time.

1928
02:20:52,577 --> 02:20:54,579
Then you got 'em both the second time.

1929
02:20:56,581 --> 02:20:57,665
This is the one?

1930
02:20:57,832 --> 02:20:58,833
Seriously?

1931
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,002
Your choices were him or a tree.

1932
02:21:11,805 --> 02:21:12,806
Cap!

1933
02:21:12,972 --> 02:21:14,812
What do you want me to do
with this damn thing?

1934
02:21:17,435 --> 02:21:19,479
Get those stones as far away as possible!

1935
02:21:19,646 --> 02:21:20,689
No!

1936
02:21:21,856 --> 02:21:23,817
We need to get 'em back
where they came from.

1937
02:21:23,983 --> 02:21:26,569
No way to get 'em back.
Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.

1938
02:21:26,736 --> 02:21:27,736
Hold on!

1939
02:21:29,447 --> 02:21:31,574
That wasn't our only time machine.

1940
02:21:37,580 --> 02:21:39,499
Anyone see an ugly brown van out there?

1941
02:21:40,041 --> 02:21:43,128
Yes! But you're not gonna like
where it's parked!

1942
02:21:43,294 --> 02:21:45,422
Scott, how long you need
to get that thing working?

1943
02:21:46,798 --> 02:21:47,799
Maybe 10 minutes.

1944
02:21:47,966 --> 02:21:49,610
Get it started.
We'll get the stones to you.

1945
02:21:49,634 --> 02:21:51,177
We're on it, Cap.

1946
02:22:00,937 --> 02:22:02,063
Hey.

1947
02:22:02,230 --> 02:22:05,233
You said one out of 14 million,
we win, yeah?

1948
02:22:06,151 --> 02:22:07,152
Tell me this is it.

1949
02:22:07,569 --> 02:22:09,446
If I tell you what happens...

1950
02:22:09,612 --> 02:22:10,780
it won't happen.

1951
02:22:14,367 --> 02:22:15,368
You better be right.

1952
02:22:23,793 --> 02:22:25,170
It's a mess back here.

1953
02:22:26,171 --> 02:22:27,172
It's dead.

1954
02:22:28,465 --> 02:22:29,966
- What?
- It's dead.

1955
02:22:30,133 --> 02:22:31,551
I have to hot-wire it.

1956
02:22:34,637 --> 02:22:35,847
Where's Nebula?

1957
02:22:36,973 --> 02:22:38,308
She's not responding.

1958
02:22:38,683 --> 02:22:40,018
Sire...

1959
02:22:49,778 --> 02:22:51,029
Clint!

1960
02:22:53,073 --> 02:22:54,199
Give it to me.

1961
02:23:16,471 --> 02:23:19,849
You took everything from me.

1962
02:23:20,225 --> 02:23:22,560
I don't even know who you are.

1963
02:23:22,727 --> 02:23:24,354
You will.

1964
02:23:46,793 --> 02:23:47,793
I got it!

1965
02:23:50,296 --> 02:23:51,381
Activate Instant Kill.

1966
02:24:14,821 --> 02:24:16,156
Rain fire!

1967
02:24:16,865 --> 02:24:18,783
But, sire, our troops!

1968
02:24:18,950 --> 02:24:20,702
Just do it!

1969
02:24:40,847 --> 02:24:43,224
Is anyone else seeing this?

1970
02:24:57,155 --> 02:24:58,281
I got this!

1971
02:24:58,531 --> 02:25:00,325
I got this.
Okay, I don't got this.

1972
02:25:00,658 --> 02:25:01,826
Help, somebody help!

1973
02:25:01,993 --> 02:25:03,870
Hey, Queens, heads up!

1974
02:25:13,922 --> 02:25:14,964
Hang on. I got you, kid.

1975
02:25:18,593 --> 02:25:19,761
Hey! Nice to meet you...

1976
02:25:19,928 --> 02:25:21,763
Oh, my God!

1977
02:25:58,008 --> 02:25:59,467
What the hell is this?

1978
02:26:00,260 --> 02:26:01,487
Friday, what are they firing at?

1979
02:26:01,511 --> 02:26:03,388
Something just entered
the upper atmosphere.

1980
02:26:16,651 --> 02:26:18,820
Oh, yeah!

1981
02:26:38,715 --> 02:26:41,134
Danvers, we need an assist here.

1982
02:26:49,893 --> 02:26:52,479
Hi, I'm Peter Parker.

1983
02:26:53,104 --> 02:26:54,522
Hey, Peter Parker.

1984
02:26:54,689 --> 02:26:55,857
You got something for me?

1985
02:27:01,988 --> 02:27:04,228
I don't know how you're gonna get it
through all of that.

1986
02:27:05,742 --> 02:27:07,160
Don't worry.

1987
02:27:08,036 --> 02:27:09,621
She's got help.

1988
02:29:57,455 --> 02:30:00,959
I am inevitable.

1989
02:30:21,062 --> 02:30:22,605
And I...

1990
02:30:24,274 --> 02:30:25,442
am...

1991
02:30:29,154 --> 02:30:30,655
Iron Man.

1992
02:32:29,357 --> 02:32:31,067
Mr. Stark?

1993
02:32:31,484 --> 02:32:32,736
Hey!

1994
02:32:33,737 --> 02:32:36,698
Mr. Stark. Can you hear me?

1995
02:32:36,865 --> 02:32:38,408
It's Peter.

1996
02:32:39,701 --> 02:32:41,327
Hey.

1997
02:32:42,370 --> 02:32:45,415
We won, Mr. Stark.

1998
02:32:47,250 --> 02:32:49,419
We won, Mr. Stark.

1999
02:32:51,046 --> 02:32:53,882
We won!
You did it, sir, you did it.

2000
02:32:54,799 --> 02:32:56,092
I'm sorry.

2001
02:32:56,259 --> 02:32:57,260
Tony.

2002
02:33:10,940 --> 02:33:11,983
Hey.

2003
02:33:12,150 --> 02:33:13,985
Hey, Pep.

2004
02:33:18,281 --> 02:33:19,366
Friday?

2005
02:33:19,532 --> 02:33:22,285
Life functions critical.

2006
02:33:30,877 --> 02:33:31,878
Tony?

2007
02:33:33,129 --> 02:33:34,214
Look at me.

2008
02:33:36,883 --> 02:33:38,802
We're gonna be okay.

2009
02:33:43,515 --> 02:33:45,392
You can rest now.

2010
02:35:30,914 --> 02:35:33,708
Everybody wants a happy ending, right?

2011
02:35:33,875 --> 02:35:36,086
But it doesn't always roll that way.

2012
02:35:38,171 --> 02:35:39,839
Maybe this time.

2013
02:35:41,424 --> 02:35:44,094
I'm hoping if you play this back...

2014
02:35:45,762 --> 02:35:47,097
it's in celebration.

2015
02:35:48,348 --> 02:35:52,018
I hope families are reunited.
I hope we get it back.

2016
02:35:52,185 --> 02:35:56,106
And something like a normal version
of the planet has been restored.

2017
02:35:56,272 --> 02:35:58,233
If there ever was such a thing.

2018
02:35:58,817 --> 02:36:01,820
God, what a world.
Universe, now.

2019
02:36:02,779 --> 02:36:04,819
If you told me 10 years ago
that we weren't alone...

2020
02:36:04,948 --> 02:36:08,618
let alone to this extent, I mean,
I wouldn't have been surprised...

2021
02:36:08,785 --> 02:36:10,412
but come on, who knew?

2022
02:36:10,578 --> 02:36:15,208
The epic forces of darkness and light
that have come into play.

2023
02:36:15,375 --> 02:36:17,085
And for better or worse...

2024
02:36:17,252 --> 02:36:21,423
that's the reality Morgan's gonna
have to find a way to grow up in.

2025
02:36:24,676 --> 02:36:26,612
So, I thought I'd probably
better record a little greeting...

2026
02:36:26,636 --> 02:36:30,265
in the case of an untimely death.
On my part.

2027
02:36:30,432 --> 02:36:33,685
Not that death at any time isn't untimely.

2028
02:36:34,894 --> 02:36:37,939
This time travel thing that we're
gonna try and pull off tomorrow...

2029
02:36:38,106 --> 02:36:40,459
it's got me scratching my head
about the survivability of it all.

2030
02:36:40,483 --> 02:36:41,943
That's the thing.

2031
02:36:43,903 --> 02:36:45,822
Then again, that's the hero gig, right?

2032
02:36:45,989 --> 02:36:47,229
Part of the journey is the end.

2033
02:36:49,075 --> 02:36:50,195
What am I even tripping for?

2034
02:36:50,243 --> 02:36:54,330
Everything is gonna work out
exactly the way it's supposed to.

2035
02:36:57,834 --> 02:36:59,502
I love you 3,000.

2036
02:39:14,429 --> 02:39:18,183
You know, I wish there was a way
that I could let her know.

2037
02:39:20,685 --> 02:39:22,812
That we won.

2038
02:39:24,189 --> 02:39:25,899
We did it.

2039
02:39:29,486 --> 02:39:31,279
She knows.

2040
02:39:36,159 --> 02:39:38,244
They both do.

2041
02:39:47,212 --> 02:39:48,296
How you doing, squirt?

2042
02:39:48,463 --> 02:39:49,464
Good.

2043
02:39:49,631 --> 02:39:50,965
- You good?
- Mm-hmm.

2044
02:39:51,132 --> 02:39:53,843
- Good. You hungry?
- Mm-hmm.

2045
02:39:54,260 --> 02:39:55,261
What do you want?

2046
02:39:55,970 --> 02:39:57,389
Cheeseburgers.

2047
02:40:02,185 --> 02:40:04,437
You know, your dad liked cheeseburgers.

2048
02:40:04,604 --> 02:40:06,022
Okay.

2049
02:40:08,608 --> 02:40:10,860
I'm gonna get you
all the cheeseburgers you want.

2050
02:40:11,027 --> 02:40:12,028
Okay.

2051
02:40:28,795 --> 02:40:30,213
So...

2052
02:40:30,463 --> 02:40:32,632
when can we expect you back?

2053
02:40:34,718 --> 02:40:36,052
About that...

2054
02:40:36,302 --> 02:40:38,471
Thor, your people need a king.

2055
02:40:38,638 --> 02:40:40,515
No, they already have one.

2056
02:40:42,642 --> 02:40:43,643
That's funny.

2057
02:40:49,232 --> 02:40:51,067
Are you being serious?

2058
02:40:54,738 --> 02:40:56,990
It's time for me to be who I am...

2059
02:40:57,574 --> 02:41:00,160
rather than who I'm supposed to be.

2060
02:41:01,453 --> 02:41:03,204
But you, you're a leader.

2061
02:41:03,830 --> 02:41:05,540
That's who you are.

2062
02:41:08,043 --> 02:41:10,003
You know, I'd make a lot of changes
around here.

2063
02:41:10,170 --> 02:41:11,671
I'm counting on it...

2064
02:41:11,838 --> 02:41:13,340
Your Majesty.

2065
02:41:23,475 --> 02:41:24,684
What will you do?

2066
02:41:25,435 --> 02:41:26,853
I'm not sure.

2067
02:41:27,020 --> 02:41:30,565
For the first time in a thousand years,
I have no path.

2068
02:41:30,732 --> 02:41:32,150
I do have a ride though.

2069
02:41:32,317 --> 02:41:34,277
Move it or lose it, hairbag.

2070
02:41:38,782 --> 02:41:40,325
Here we are!

2071
02:41:40,784 --> 02:41:42,327
Tree, good to see you.

2072
02:41:46,915 --> 02:41:50,210
The Asgardians of the Galaxy
back together again.

2073
02:41:50,627 --> 02:41:52,504
Where to first?

2074
02:41:53,630 --> 02:41:54,673
Hey.

2075
02:41:55,298 --> 02:41:57,258
Just so you know,
this is my ship still.

2076
02:41:57,425 --> 02:41:58,426
I'm in charge.

2077
02:41:58,968 --> 02:42:01,513
I know. I know.
Of course you are.

2078
02:42:01,680 --> 02:42:03,223
Of course.

2079
02:42:05,850 --> 02:42:08,395
See, you say, "Of course,"
but then you touch the map.

2080
02:42:08,561 --> 02:42:11,121
It makes you think that maybe
you didn't realize I was in charge.

2081
02:42:11,690 --> 02:42:13,167
Quail, that's your own
insecurities in there.

2082
02:42:13,191 --> 02:42:14,192
Quail?

2083
02:42:14,359 --> 02:42:16,611
Okay? I am merely trying to be of service
and assisting.

2084
02:42:16,778 --> 02:42:17,987
Quill.

2085
02:42:18,154 --> 02:42:19,154
That's what I said.

2086
02:42:19,197 --> 02:42:21,574
You should fight one another
for the honor of leadership.

2087
02:42:21,741 --> 02:42:23,118
Sounds fair.

2088
02:42:25,870 --> 02:42:28,248
- It's not necessary, okay?
- It's not.

2089
02:42:28,415 --> 02:42:30,792
I got some blasters,
unless you guys wanna use knives.

2090
02:42:30,959 --> 02:42:33,169
Oh, yes! Please, use knives.

2091
02:42:33,336 --> 02:42:34,421
Yeah. Knives.

2092
02:42:34,587 --> 02:42:36,131
I am Groot.

2093
02:42:41,886 --> 02:42:43,263
Not necessary.

2094
02:42:43,430 --> 02:42:44,950
There shall be no knifing one another.

2095
02:42:45,056 --> 02:42:48,059
Everybody knows who's in charge.

2096
02:42:51,646 --> 02:42:52,856
Me.

2097
02:42:53,940 --> 02:42:54,940
Right?

2098
02:42:55,692 --> 02:42:57,902
Yes, you.

2099
02:42:58,153 --> 02:43:00,572
Of course! Of course.

2100
02:43:00,739 --> 02:43:02,407
Of course.

2101
02:43:04,159 --> 02:43:05,702
Remember...

2102
02:43:06,536 --> 02:43:08,973
you have to return the stones
to the exact moment you got 'em...

2103
02:43:08,997 --> 02:43:12,208
or you're gonna open up
a bunch of nasty alternative realities.

2104
02:43:12,375 --> 02:43:13,376
Don't worry, Bruce.

2105
02:43:13,918 --> 02:43:15,795
Clip all the branches.

2106
02:43:16,338 --> 02:43:18,089
You know, I tried.

2107
02:43:19,382 --> 02:43:23,595
When I had the gauntlet, the stones,
I really tried to bring her back.

2108
02:43:26,890 --> 02:43:28,516
I miss her, man.

2109
02:43:28,892 --> 02:43:29,893
Me too.

2110
02:43:33,980 --> 02:43:36,399
You know, if you want,
I could come with you.

2111
02:43:38,985 --> 02:43:40,445
You're a good man, Sam.

2112
02:43:40,987 --> 02:43:42,530
This one's on me, though.

2113
02:43:46,993 --> 02:43:48,912
Don't do anything stupid till I get back.

2114
02:43:50,747 --> 02:43:51,998
How can I?

2115
02:43:52,165 --> 02:43:53,958
You're taking all the stupid with you.

2116
02:44:01,549 --> 02:44:03,343
Gonna miss you, buddy.

2117
02:44:03,718 --> 02:44:05,220
It's gonna be okay, Buck.

2118
02:44:12,602 --> 02:44:14,396
How long is this gonna take?

2119
02:44:14,646 --> 02:44:17,399
For him, as long as he needs.
For us, five seconds.

2120
02:44:22,487 --> 02:44:23,738
You ready, Cap?

2121
02:44:23,905 --> 02:44:26,324
All right, we'll meet you back here, okay?

2122
02:44:26,991 --> 02:44:28,118
You bet.

2123
02:44:29,619 --> 02:44:31,204
Going quantum. Three...

2124
02:44:31,788 --> 02:44:32,788
two...

2125
02:44:33,289 --> 02:44:34,499
one.

2126
02:44:36,376 --> 02:44:38,420
And returning in five...

2127
02:44:38,586 --> 02:44:39,586
four...

2128
02:44:39,713 --> 02:44:41,548
three, two...

2129
02:44:41,715 --> 02:44:43,049
one.

2130
02:44:50,306 --> 02:44:51,307
Where is he?

2131
02:44:51,474 --> 02:44:53,274
I don't know.
He blew right by his time stamp.

2132
02:44:53,393 --> 02:44:54,853
He should be here.

2133
02:45:00,358 --> 02:45:01,358
Get him back.

2134
02:45:01,443 --> 02:45:02,712
- I'm trying.
- Get him the hell back.

2135
02:45:02,736 --> 02:45:04,612
- Hey, I said I'm trying.
- Sam.

2136
02:45:28,595 --> 02:45:30,180
Go ahead.

2137
02:45:48,156 --> 02:45:49,156
Cap?

2138
02:45:51,242 --> 02:45:52,994
Hi, Sam.

2139
02:45:55,997 --> 02:45:59,042
So, did something go wrong
or did something go right?

2140
02:46:01,169 --> 02:46:05,006
Well, after I put the stones back,
I thought...

2141
02:46:06,132 --> 02:46:07,467
maybe...

2142
02:46:07,967 --> 02:46:12,764
I'll try some of that life
Tony was telling me to get.

2143
02:46:14,766 --> 02:46:16,893
How'd that work out for ya?

2144
02:46:19,396 --> 02:46:20,814
It was beautiful.

2145
02:46:22,148 --> 02:46:23,858
Good. I'm happy for you.

2146
02:46:24,025 --> 02:46:25,068
Truly.

2147
02:46:25,819 --> 02:46:27,112
Thank you.

2148
02:46:28,446 --> 02:46:29,698
Only thing bumming me out...

2149
02:46:29,864 --> 02:46:33,451
is the fact I have to live in a world
without Captain America.

2150
02:46:37,247 --> 02:46:40,041
That reminds me.

2151
02:46:48,550 --> 02:46:49,759
Try it on.

2152
02:47:15,285 --> 02:47:16,786
How does it feel?

2153
02:47:19,372 --> 02:47:21,082
Like it's someone else's.

2154
02:47:24,127 --> 02:47:25,295
It isn't.

2155
02:47:38,641 --> 02:47:40,226
Thank you.

2156
02:47:41,936 --> 02:47:43,229
I'll do my best.

2157
02:47:48,610 --> 02:47:50,528
That's why it's yours.

2158
02:47:52,238 --> 02:47:53,615
You wanna tell me about her?

2159
02:48:00,205 --> 02:48:01,706
No.

2160
02:48:02,123 --> 02:48:04,250
No, I don't think I will.
